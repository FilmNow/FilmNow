1
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:24,647
Gentlemen!

2
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:28,355
That's it for today.
Turn everything off!

3
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,813
Change your clothes.
The buses are waiting.

4
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,105
Get a move on!

5
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:36,397
Are you deaf? I said turn it off.

6
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:37,813
Hurry up!

7
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,272
The factory's closing
while we wait for raw materials.

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
You will be paid.

9
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:49,938
We'll contact you next week
about your wages.

10
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:53,313
Go back to the dorms!

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,188
Get out of your uniforms,

12
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:59,522
take all your things
and get on the buses.

13
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:02,730
If you dawdle,
you won't find a ride out tonight.

14
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:12,897
We're closing!

15
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,063
Get up, hurry!

16
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,063
Move it!

17
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:21,147
And don't even think about going to HR.

18
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,772
Don't cause trouble for yourselves.

19
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,647
The factory
could press charges against you.

20
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,980
You could be arrested

21
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:31,522
and lose your pay.

22
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:03,022
Hello.

23
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,772
Have a seat.

24
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:41,105
Hello, Bayram.

25
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:43,647
Thank you.

26
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:46,147
- Sit down, please.
- No, thank you.

27
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:50,063
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

28
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,105
8 MONTHS
NO PAY

29
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,605
28 MONTHS
NO HEALTHCARE

30
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,522
Hello.

31
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,272
Ghardashali,

32
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:48,188
I'm not imposing anything on anyone.

33
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:51,313
Personally, I'm still mourning.

34
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:56,605
You're free to do
what you think is right.

35
00:07:56,772 --> 00:08:00,313
Bayram, you know that
as long as you're in mourning,

36
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,563
we'll all wear black.

37
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:11,813
Say a prayer for the deceased!

38
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,563
May Gholam rest in peace,
my dear Bayram.

39
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,147
May God protect you.

40
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:24,480
- A small gift.
- You shouldn't have.

41
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:29,063
Gholam was my cousin,
but he was like a father to me.

42
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,188
That's very kind, really,
but you shouldn't have.

43
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:36,480
If I may, I'd also like
to trim your hair and beard

44
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,980
to take you out of mourning.

45
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:41,230
Are you suddenly a barber?

46
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,063
Go sit down and let us convince him.

47
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,272
- This way.
- Come sit.

48
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:48,397
Come have a seat.

49
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:52,438
Make yourself comfortable.

50
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:53,646
Bayram,

51
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:57,022
as long as you wear black
the family will, too.

52
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:02,563
Alright, trim your hair and beards
and stop wearing black.

53
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,897
With all due respect,

54
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:07,105
Gholam was our patriarch,

55
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:09,730
we're waiting for you
to name his successor.

56
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:11,730
But I'm still mourning.

57
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,355
It's been a year!

58
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:15,522
Succession obeys its own rules.

59
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,730
You'll read his will when I see fit.

60
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:18,938
His will?

61
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,147
You haven't opened it yet?

62
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:22,522
Of course I have.

63
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,688
And no one knows anything?

64
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,938
My father asked
for one year deferment.

65
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,312
And now?

66
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:29,730
I'm not ready yet.

67
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:35,772
Dad, four couples
are waiting to plan their weddings.

68
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:38,355
You're not speaking for yourself?

69
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:42,313
Everyone's saying it.
Come here, Dad.

70
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:46,813
I understand him.
He's tired of waiting.

71
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:51,980
We all thought your son
would get married after the 40th day,

72
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:55,188
and that the others would follow.

73
00:09:56,647 --> 00:10:00,938
Honestly, if you let these poor kids
get on with their lives,

74
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:03,730
no one will think less of you.

75
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,522
Please, Bayram.

76
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,272
Let us say a prayer!

77
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:30,688
The bastards are the ones who flee,
counting on their colleagues

78
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,147
to fight for their wages.

79
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:39,688
Just use the trimmer.

80
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:42,855
I'll let you know.

81
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,938
I'll call you back.

82
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,313
Bye.

83
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:54,022
Name the successor today
and get it over with.

84
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:56,063
Are you pressing for Ghardashali?

85
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,647
He offered to plan
your son's wedding.

86
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:00,272
My son has a father.

87
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:02,022
Excuse me, Bayram.

88
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,272
Ghardashali
deserves to be patriarch.

89
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,563
But I'm the eldest.

90
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,480
Say, Ghardashali?
Is he the eldest?

91
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,730
- Who?
- Esmail.

92
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,813
That piker shirks weddings
to avoid giving gifts.

93
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,397
He's after free lunches.

94
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:19,772
That's no way to speak in public.

95
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,105
He hasn't even helped his own children.

96
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,230
What a patriarch he'd make!

97
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:28,147
Show some decency.
Who's older, you or him?

98
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,063
Me, obviously.

99
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,397
God is my witness,

100
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:35,063
I don't expect to be Gholam's successor.

101
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,147
Be my guest.
We're all behind you!

102
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,438
I was six when you were born,
Ghardashali.

103
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:43,313
My mother nursed you.

104
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,563
It's not only about age.

105
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,022
Exactly.

106
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:50,355
I was just saying I'm the eldest.

107
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:54,605
While Ghardashali
was Gholam's friend in his last moments.

108
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,563
Well said!

109
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,897
If Gholam is satisfied,
we'll all be satisfied!

110
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:46,188
LEILA'S BROTHERS

111
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:49,563
A film by Saeed Roustaee

112
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,855
Did you know it was my crib?

113
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,730
It was mine.

114
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:09,980
Yes, it was all of ours.

115
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:11,647
You still in there, Dad?

116
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:13,855
I can't help it. It hurts.

117
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:16,605
Leila,
you've used up all the city's water.

118
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:19,022
Take me to see a doctor, Alireza.

119
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,438
Take him where?

120
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,355
Ignore him, he's fine.

121
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,230
Where's my car key? Dad!

122
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:31,022
You didn't pay me yesterday.

123
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,230
I was at the garage all day.

124
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:34,772
Where's the second key?

125
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:36,730
If you touch it,

126
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:40,480
I'll call the police on you!

127
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:44,397
Do what you did to Parviz.

128
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,397
Go ahead and take me to court.

129
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,730
Shut the water off, I don't have any!

130
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:58,605
Let's take the elevator.

131
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:00,688
I can't breathe in that thing!

132
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,230
Is it a boy?

133
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,522
I swear it is.

134
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:06,438
You swear nonsense.

135
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:07,938
Swear on Manouchehr's life!

136
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,897
On Farhad's life, it's a boy.

137
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,855
That means it's a girl.

138
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:15,438
Don't bug them
about naming him Gholam.

139
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:16,813
Butt out.

140
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
You're the one who's butting in.

141
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,313
For Gholam's memorial,

142
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,563
I was the first to be dressed in white
and have my beard trimmed.

143
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,605
It's expected of me.

144
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,730
Come meet the baby, will you?

145
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:30,980
Where's Manouchehr?

146
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:34,230
The sissy
can't handle the smell of hospitals.

147
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:41,522
Finally, someone who's not empty-handed!

148
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,730
Hello, my sweethearts!

149
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,313
Good to see you.

150
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,605
You're lucky this one's a boy.

151
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,605
Yep. He'd keep harassing me otherwise.

152
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:54,897
Congratulations.

153
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,897
Let me kiss my grandchild.

154
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,480
You can't kiss a newborn's face.

155
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,730
It's not a boy.

156
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:03,480
'Course it is, check.

157
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,147
Have her undress him then.

158
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:06,438
He'll catch cold.

159
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:11,272
For every one of those five girls,
they told me it was a boy.

160
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:15,897
After 2 years, I'd suddenly see them
wearing skirts and earrings.

161
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,772
This time, they won't fool me.

162
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:19,271
Undress him!

163
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,730
It's not easy to unwrap.

164
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:24,022
Don't delude me, evil woman!

165
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:27,022
Calm down, sir.
You're in a hospital.

166
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:28,188
Please leave.

167
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,341
Forgive him.

168
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,813
You're embarrassing us.

169
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,022
Leila, show him
before he has a heart attack.

170
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:35,188
Come look.

171
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:38,772
Hold on.

172
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,188
There we are.

173
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:53,647
What a joy.

174
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,563
It's a boy!

175
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:01,022
It's a boy.

176
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,397
See that?

177
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:04,897
Didn't he have enough boys?

178
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:06,897
He's your humble servant.

179
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,730
Look at those lashes.
He's so handsome...

180
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,063
Don't pout, eat.
I'll take you to a doctor tomorrow.

181
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:04,813
Damn that Brock Lesnar!

182
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,855
The only guy who can beat Undertaker
is Lesnar.

183
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:11,355
- It's all phony.
- It is not.

184
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:14,813
Hardy jumps from a 30-ft ladder
onto Big Show's face.

185
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,438
Is that phony?

186
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:21,397
She forgets our names,
but she knows the wrestlers' by heart!

187
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:23,230
That's your fault.

188
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,980
Orton's gonna crush Lesnar, Mom.

189
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:27,522
He's no Shawn Michaels.

190
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:30,105
I have the same build as Orton,
don't I?

191
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:34,355
Stop it, you orangutan!
Put your clothes back on!

192
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:35,938
Are they dressed?

193
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:39,397
Sister-in-law, it's my back again.
Take the baby.

194
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,438
I'm so sorry.

195
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,458
Ouch!

196
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,772
Don't do the dishes.

197
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:47,855
Get married and that pain'll go away.

198
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:51,397
Farhad,
you can't just eat and do nothing.

199
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,772
We should deal with the dishes.

200
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:56,355
- I'm still eating.
- I mean in general.

201
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,980
You ruminate like a cow.
That's enough.

202
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:00,938
Do you mean me or Parviz?

203
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,438
Wait till we clear the dishes.

204
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:04,980
In two minutes,
he'll have his pants down.

205
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,730
Dad, blow for the baby.

206
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:10,188
He's in a hurry to go home.

207
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:13,022
Because he knows what he's done.

208
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,605
Congratulations.

209
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,563
What's the matter with you?

210
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,855
May he have a long and happy life.

211
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:21,772
Tell me,

212
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:24,397
what's the name
on the birth certificate?

213
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,730
The name you asked for.

214
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,813
- What name is that?
- Gholam.

215
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:30,563
Gholam.

216
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,522
- Show me his record.
- We don't have it.

217
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,855
What is this then?

218
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:38,522
I picked it up today.
Parviz didn't know.

219
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:41,313
Read it and tell me
what they named the kid.

220
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
It's Gholam.

221
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:46,813
Gholam.

222
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
What is it to us?

223
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:52,688
Alireza,
are they telling me the truth?

224
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:04,897
Yes. It's Gholam.

225
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:08,813
Where does it say Gholam?
Point the word out to me.

226
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:11,480
Right here.

227
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,313
Give me my bank card.

228
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:21,580
Why?

229
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:23,647
I don't want you to have it.

230
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:49,147
DEATH ANNOUNCEMENT

231
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:56,105
GHOLAM

232
00:22:57,313 --> 00:22:58,438
POUYAN

233
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:06,980
It's not Gholam!

234
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:09,563
Get out, you dirty liars!

235
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:13,022
I knew the bastards wouldn't listen.

236
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:16,022
Get out, you thief!

237
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,647
Think of your heart.

238
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,105
You're scaring the girls.

239
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,897
- Get lost, all of you.
- They're gone.

240
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,104
You, come here.

241
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,730
What's gotten into you, Dad?

242
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:27,063
Have you lost your mind?

243
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,563
He steals my pension
and he steals from my home.

244
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,188
Leila put it in my bag.

245
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:36,313
Raheleh is breastfeeding, Dad!

246
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:43,522
After a year, my wife
finally comes to dinner. Thank you.

247
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,188
Get over here.

248
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,647
Stop it, Dad.

249
00:24:10,522 --> 00:24:12,772
He doesn't want to name his son Gholam!

250
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:15,480
Go to hell, both of you!

251
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:18,355
You could've named
one of your four sons Gholam!

252
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:21,563
Gholam was still alive then.
It isn't done, fool.

253
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,688
Screw your traditions!

254
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,355
Bayram can name
his own grandkid Gholam.

255
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,022
We'd preempt him!

256
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:29,397
What for?

257
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:31,647
To hold our heads up high.

258
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:35,355
Did being named after your father
bring me luck?

259
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:40,105
Why would I have to name my son
after your half-wit cousin?

260
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,897
You're eligible
for unemployment benefits.

261
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:16,105
Stay home every day
from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.

262
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:18,147
We run inspections.

263
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:22,397
If you're absent,
your benefits will be suspended.

264
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,938
Excuse me, miss, I filled this out.

265
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,480
Sign here.

266
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,938
First floor, employment department.

267
00:25:29,772 --> 00:25:31,438
When do I look for a job?

268
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:36,647
There are a lot of layoffs these days.
We're very strict.

269
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,855
To keep your benefits,

270
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,730
follow the rules listed here.

271
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:42,750
Thanks.

272
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:44,813
Miss, this letter came for me.

273
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,397
Booth number 7, income department.

274
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,980
There's a seat here.

275
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:55,105
I'll go get a number.

276
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:56,772
Have a seat, Dad.

277
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,313
- Wait in line.
- It's just a form.

278
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,605
Internal medicine, Jourablou.

279
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:12,355
It's packed...

280
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:15,813
It's a state hospital. Could be worse.

281
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,688
Excuse me, ma'am.

282
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:26,480
Dad, we're right here.

283
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,313
Could you please not ask Mom and Dad
how they're feeling?

284
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,438
Why?

285
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:47,105
I've worked hard weening them off
asking for a doctor every day.

286
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,022
You show up, and here we go again.

287
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:50,688
So they're afraid of you?

288
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:53,022
Worse, they hate me.

289
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,230
But they're sick...

290
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,855
You have no idea, Alireza.

291
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,647
At their age, they need checkups.

292
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:04,897
Every doctor in town knows us.

293
00:27:05,397 --> 00:27:08,730
I'm only here for four days.

294
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,688
Why are you saying that?

295
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:15,397
Things are tense, so you run for it?

296
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:17,397
I have to go back to work.

297
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:20,688
You can't lie to me
the way you lie to the others.

298
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:24,230
You're out of a job,
like your brothers.

299
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:26,397
You're unemployed.

300
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,522
You only have to spend one night at home
for me to know

301
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,105
everything about you.

302
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:33,397
You were fired.

303
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:36,897
You get fired
when you do something wrong.

304
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:39,772
The owner was crooked,
the factory went bankrupt.

305
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,855
They laid us off. We weren't fired.

306
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:46,647
Then stop pretending
you're on vacation.

307
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:51,355
Tell them you can't take them
to the doctor's every day

308
00:27:51,522 --> 00:27:55,897
because you have to be home
to not lose your benefits.

309
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,188
Sit down.

310
00:28:07,272 --> 00:28:09,438
Who else knows I lost my job?

311
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:14,855
Mom was thanking God
she had a son who'd have a pension.

312
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,688
Since she found out, she's lost.

313
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:19,022
How did she find out?

314
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:20,897
I told her.

315
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:24,813
I'll find a job quickly.
I don't like being idle.

316
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:29,188
A job won't change things.
We have to do something.

317
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,147
Alireza...

318
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:39,313
start a juicy business

319
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,188
and involve your brothers
to help them out of poverty.

320
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,730
Don't pressure me.
Why would that be my responsibility?

321
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,022
I tried, but I couldn't pull it off.

322
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,688
Why not ask Manouchehr?
You have three other brothers.

323
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:57,897
Manouchehr is one of the things
I'm worried about!

324
00:28:58,272 --> 00:29:03,022
If we do nothing,
he'll get caught with all his scheming.

325
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:07,105
I was counting on you to back me,
to take my side,

326
00:29:07,272 --> 00:29:09,897
and act with discernment.

327
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:15,480
Parviz can't carry his weight.
He's always looking for a place to sit.

328
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:17,813
Farhad thinks with his abs.

329
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,105
Pretend I never came.

330
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:21,355
I can't, you're here.

331
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:23,605
My presence wouldn't change anything.

332
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,313
My salary
is what keeps us from starving.

333
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,563
But...

334
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,105
Sorry, can we swap seats?

335
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,647
Yes.

336
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:37,147
Thanks.

337
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,272
What about my wages?

338
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:47,688
Your income, mine and dad's pension
is still not enough.

339
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,063
They've stagnated all their lives.

340
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:52,397
Not "they," we!

341
00:29:53,022 --> 00:29:55,897
We're not stagnating,
we're regressing.

342
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:58,980
Regressing from where?
What did we have to lose?

343
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:00,730
Our youth.

344
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:03,480
Which is slipping away.

345
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:06,272
Let's try to not end up
old and beggarly.

346
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:07,730
Brother...

347
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:10,230
don't listen to Mom and Dad.

348
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:12,522
By night, they sleep.

349
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:16,188
By day,
they think about sleeping soundly.

350
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:20,980
Everyone's miserable at home.
They hate each other.

351
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:24,897
It breaks my heart
to see them take their anger

352
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:26,522
out on each other.

353
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,938
Start a business with them.

354
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:39,563
Even though
I hate seeing my brothers jobless,

355
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,022
I was happy you were fired.

356
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:46,105
I was finally going to be able
to ask you

357
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:49,730
not to abandon your brothers.

358
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:52,022
They're on their own.

359
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:57,147
They're lost and broke.
Don't leave them like this.

360
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:02,063
If you leave again,
what will become of them?

361
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:07,855
Tell them to get their act together.

362
00:31:08,022 --> 00:31:10,355
I have. They can't.

363
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:11,522
Why not?

364
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:14,230
They don't know
how to start a business.

365
00:31:14,397 --> 00:31:15,397
And I do?

366
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:18,772
If somebody does, it's you.

367
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:23,188
Suppose we did. Who'd work?
Those lazy bums?

368
00:31:23,355 --> 00:31:25,605
They're not lazy. They're working.

369
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,480
But they have meanly jobs.

370
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:29,688
Alright, but they're morons.

371
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,397
They're not morons.

372
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:34,855
Poverty makes you lose your confidence
and look stupid.

373
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,355
I don't like conflict, sis'.

374
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,147
It stresses me out when everyone yells.

375
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:44,355
I want to work out of town
and come back on occasion.

376
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:49,063
I'm begging you, don't involve me.

377
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,105
They're your family.

378
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:54,980
I gave up a year of back wages,

379
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,897
to get away
from the ruckus at the factory.

380
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:01,855
I hate my family's hysteria.

381
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,855
Insecure jobs make people hysterical.

382
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:07,772
The harder you work, the poorer you are.

383
00:32:08,647 --> 00:32:11,980
Poverty is hard to shake off.

384
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:15,272
The more you swallow,
the more there is.

385
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:18,272
All of that is why I left.

386
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:20,230
So you're saying

387
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:24,355
you came back
only to stay if things were rosy.

388
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:26,147
And if they weren't...

389
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,105
Don't cry, Leila.

390
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:36,813
Can't you start something
that's actually a real job?

391
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:41,397
So when you fill out a form,
under "occupation"

392
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,730
you can put something down?

393
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:15,938
Yes, I told him about it.

394
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:17,855
It's settled.

395
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:21,605
Why do you neglect yourself so much?

396
00:33:21,772 --> 00:33:23,772
You weren't this fat last time.

397
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:27,022
I don't get much exercise
with this damn job.

398
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,355
He started drinking.

399
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,730
Shut up. It's my thyroid.

400
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,688
Doctor says
drinking doesn't help the thyroid.

401
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:36,730
Our place is small, the kids are noisy.

402
00:33:37,313 --> 00:33:39,355
Sometimes I drink to get to sleep.

403
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:41,980
- Where you going?
- To the bathroom.

404
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:43,397
Let it dry.

405
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,813
I really need to go.

406
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,647
- Got any cash?
- Yes.

407
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,355
Go ahead.

408
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:55,688
White tiles need constant cleaning.

409
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,563
Why'd you ask us to come?

410
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,647
They want to turn the bathroom
into a bunch of shops.

411
00:34:03,313 --> 00:34:05,980
He's right. It's being green-lit.

412
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,688
What's it to us?

413
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:09,188
I thought you should see it.

414
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:11,772
Alireza, we have to act quickly.

415
00:34:11,938 --> 00:34:15,438
The other shop owners
will soon get their claws into it.

416
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:18,272
To become wealthy,
you have to be in the know.

417
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:19,938
Where'd you hear it?

418
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:21,730
Nowhere. It's my flare.

419
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:22,897
Stop it.

420
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,688
I overheard your financial manager here.

421
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:30,772
I asked if we could buy
a small shop with a loan.

422
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,397
- Price per square foot?
- 15 to 20 million.

423
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:35,105
We can't afford it.

424
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,397
I can barely afford a square foot.

425
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,438
The others are worse off.

426
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:42,188
Give it a chance.
Maybe we can pull it off.

427
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:43,605
My boss likes me.

428
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:45,730
Even without a deposit, we can't.

429
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,230
Are you a naysayer
like Manouchehr now?

430
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:51,188
Fine. Where would we find the money?

431
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:05,105
Alright, never mind.

432
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,438
You're not letting them think.

433
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,022
Buying a shop requires money,
not thought.

434
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:12,188
This scale is off.

435
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:15,272
If you want it, it'll work.

436
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:17,147
Suppose I did.

437
00:35:17,397 --> 00:35:19,272
You have to actually want it!

438
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:21,313
Is it all on me?

439
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,813
I'm all for it.
That's why I'm here.

440
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,063
I asked you to come. I want it.

441
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:30,147
If we're just talking, I do too.

442
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:32,438
We all want it deep down.

443
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,938
Same here. Me too.

444
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:38,438
Where you going?

445
00:35:39,647 --> 00:35:42,230
Last time, I paid for two visits.

446
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:43,772
I don't remember that.

447
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:45,105
How much?

448
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,230
What did you do?

449
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:49,397
What?
I used the bathroom for a minute.

450
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,980
You took longer than a minute.
Gimme 500.

451
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:58,230
Do you have change this time?

452
00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:00,272
No. I won't charge you next time.

453
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:01,813
What if you forget again?

454
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,647
You'll remind me, jog my memory.

455
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:10,147
If he files a complaint,
I'll have no other job for you.

456
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:30,188
Wake him up,
so he can sleep in his bed.

457
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,772
Since he got his pacemaker,
he often sleeps like that.

458
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:38,147
He says that if he lies down,
he feels like he's dying.

459
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:40,355
Go listen.

460
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:10,772
Look, son.

461
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,105
If I don't bandage myself,
it tingles all night.

462
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:16,605
Shouldn't we see a doctor?

463
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:19,022
Sure. I'll see to it tomorrow.

464
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,938
We have a lot to do tomorrow.
Don't make promises.

465
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,480
Here, Mom, take your pills.

466
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:32,563
And use your ointment
against the tingling.

467
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,938
Dad.

468
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:36,313
Don't, he just fell asleep.

469
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,563
Take your pills.

470
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,438
He'll take them tomorrow.

471
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:42,313
If he doesn't take them,
he'll be sick tomorrow.

472
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,897
Mom loves the big guys.

473
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,230
Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Big Show.

474
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:58,730
That's why she loves Parviz so much.

475
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,355
With her bandages,
she could all knock 'em all out.

476
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:07,522
Don't get in front of the TV.

477
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:11,938
I called Manouchehr about the shop.

478
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,105
And?

479
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:16,688
He says that our problem is the deposit,

480
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:18,897
but that he's got a plan.

481
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:23,105
Is it seducing old, depressed,
rich women?

482
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,772
"Sugar mommy!"

483
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:27,730
He set up an appointment
for tomorrow night.

484
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:30,022
He'll explain everything.

485
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,272
He was ashamed
to say we were his brothers.

486
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:37,022
Why do business with us now?

487
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:48,980
Good evening.

488
00:38:51,355 --> 00:38:52,480
Why are you here?

489
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:54,396
Why shouldn't I be?

490
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:55,813
Wait at my place.

491
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:59,522
It's a man's thing, sis'.

492
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:01,272
Then he can't come.

493
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:04,813
Should I open my mouth
to dump on you?

494
00:39:05,272 --> 00:39:07,272
He shits from his mouth?

495
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:10,063
That's disgusting!

496
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:11,980
Just asking.

497
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:14,897
Go upstairs and rest
until we get back.

498
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,438
I can't go up all those stairs.

499
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,605
Take the elevator,
it's in perfect working order.

500
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,522
I'd rather die than get in that thing.

501
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:27,355
It takes Parviz up easy.

502
00:39:28,105 --> 00:39:29,072
Nice.

503
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:31,147
You weigh less.
Here's the remote.

504
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:34,897
Don't sign anything
until we all discuss it.

505
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:36,104
Sure.

506
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:37,897
We're late, hurry.

507
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:42,313
How you doing, brother?

508
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,605
Good, thanks.

509
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:39,188
Don't drive off the cliff!

510
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,063
Why on earth would anyone pay money

511
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,480
to buy an apartment in this shithole?

512
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:47,897
Wait till I get the deed. You'll see.

513
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:49,688
You don't have a deed?

514
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:52,688
Not until the gas is hooked up.

515
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:54,730
Good God, there's no gas?

516
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:58,688
His unit has two windowless
40 sq. ft bedrooms.

517
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,605
He doesn't even have access
to the staircase.

518
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:02,772
Is that true?

519
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:04,647
He's full of shit.

520
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:06,855
It used to be two stories,
two owners.

521
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:10,438
The downstairs guy
illegally built a basement.

522
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:14,647
So the upstairs guy
built a revenge apartment on the roof.

523
00:41:14,865 --> 00:41:15,897
And?

524
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:18,397
The downstairs guy
blocked off the staircase

525
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,522
and we fitted an elevator outside.

526
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:22,855
Who'd buy a place like that?

527
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,397
You can brag about your brother
who lives uptown.

528
00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:29,605
Uptown ended way before this back alley.

529
00:41:29,772 --> 00:41:32,313
This is a shantytown, you moron.

530
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:35,230
Blockhead saw it.
I have a majestic view.

531
00:41:35,397 --> 00:41:39,605
Sure, majestic until someone
builds right in front of it.

532
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:41,730
Or city hall tears it down.

533
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:44,647
Look at those cars!

534
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,813
Uptown, he says.

535
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:50,355
You're something else, Manouchehr.

536
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:03,188
Let's go.

537
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,855
Prepare to be blown away.

538
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:14,522
Thanks, Mahmoud.
Great tea!

539
00:43:14,897 --> 00:43:16,147
Help yourself.

540
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,105
I'll leave the tray here.

541
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:24,188
Mahmoud has a super job here.

542
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,563
You're welcome.

543
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:29,105
High income, low hassle.

544
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,897
He's making this offer
as a favor to me.

545
00:43:33,063 --> 00:43:34,063
No.

546
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,272
Now that we're roommates,
I love him like a brother.

547
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:39,272
He lives at your place?

548
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:41,188
No, I live at his.

549
00:43:41,522 --> 00:43:43,355
Six months ago, I was homeless.

550
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:46,188
You set all this up in six months?

551
00:43:46,605 --> 00:43:49,563
I didn't set it up, but I run it now.

552
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,855
Does it belong to you or not?

553
00:43:52,188 --> 00:43:53,938
It belongs to whoever works here.

554
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,022
I'm sorry, what's the job exactly?

555
00:43:57,188 --> 00:43:58,397
Let me explain...

556
00:43:58,563 --> 00:43:59,813
May I?

557
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,188
This is a car leasing company.

558
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:08,313
The factory delivers a Kia Pride
in thirty days for 23 million.

559
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,105
Mahmoud delivers it in three months,
but for 20 million.

560
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:14,397
Wait, Manouchehr.

561
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:17,813
Do you get the cars from the factory
or a middleman?

562
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,230
Neither.

563
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:22,230
We never actually deliver the cars.

564
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,063
I'm sorry, you take people's money
and disappear?

565
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,772
- Come on, brother...
- It's OK.

566
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:33,605
A fraudster leaves the cash
under his mattress.

567
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:37,063
I have ten bank accounts.
Manouchehr knows this.

568
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,647
You take the money
and never deliver the car. How?

569
00:44:40,813 --> 00:44:41,813
What's his name?

570
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:42,818
Alireza.

571
00:44:42,855 --> 00:44:44,522
Ali, it's not complicated.

572
00:44:44,688 --> 00:44:46,938
Listen and you'll understand.

573
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:49,938
Before me, my brother-in-law was here.

574
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:54,147
My brother-in-law presold 1,000 cars
and left with the money.

575
00:44:54,313 --> 00:44:56,313
I took over the office.

576
00:44:56,688 --> 00:45:01,730
First, I presold a 1,000 Prides
to pay off my brother-in-law's debt,

577
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:05,397
to the same people,
before they filed a complaint.

578
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:06,938
Then,

579
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:11,063
I presold another 1,000 Prides
and pocketed the money.

580
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,313
So if you take over this office:

581
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,855
First you pay off my debt,

582
00:45:16,022 --> 00:45:20,147
then you pocket the money
from the next 1,000 presales.

583
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:22,647
And pass the buck to the next guy.

584
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:25,313
Who will do the same.

585
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,730
First, pay off your debt.
Then, pocket the money.

586
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:30,587
- So on and so forth.
- It's a cycle.

587
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:31,855
I get it.

588
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:35,647
I'm sorry,
so you're looking for a successor?

589
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:37,855
For someone to take over the office.

590
00:45:38,022 --> 00:45:40,980
Mahmoud is looking for someone
to replace him.

591
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:44,688
That's all you do from this huge office?

592
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,021
Listen.

593
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:48,813
1,000 times 20 million
is 20 billion tomans.

594
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,813
In current dollars...

595
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,272
- What's the exchange rate?
- 5,000.

596
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:55,897
That's 4 million dollars.

597
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:58,272
We'll be millionaires in dollars!

598
00:45:58,438 --> 00:46:00,605
Don't people file complaints?

599
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:02,772
Not for two-month delays.

600
00:46:03,188 --> 00:46:04,897
Suppose a handful do.

601
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:08,313
We buy a couple of Prides,
end of story.

602
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,813
Not necessary!

603
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,313
Throw them back their 20,
and they're happy.

604
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,063
In my opinion, it's very low risk.

605
00:46:17,563 --> 00:46:18,647
Ali...

606
00:46:19,605 --> 00:46:22,855
I left my wife and kids
with 80 million in debt

607
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:26,772
and came to Tehran
to sit on that couch.

608
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:31,772
When they pitched it to me,
I was apprehensive.

609
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:34,813
But now,
my house back home is so big

610
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,355
my wife calls the cops
to find the kids.

611
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,438
My three offices are proof it works.

612
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:47,188
But you're living in my brother's hovel?

613
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:50,063
Question of opportunity.

614
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,813
An uptown address,
cheaper than the south, is a no-brainer.

615
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:57,855
I've seen Mahmoud's advancement
with my own two eyes.

616
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,355
It's impressive.

617
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,147
Are your permits in order?

618
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,980
If they weren't, we couldn't advertise.

619
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,105
How much would it cost
for us to take over?

620
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,605
The rent and advertising costs

621
00:47:11,772 --> 00:47:13,730
are my gift for a year.

622
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:17,522
But one of you has to sign,
accept responsibility.

623
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:20,772
Seriously, what more could we ask for?

624
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,438
It's a golden opportunity.

625
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:23,772
He has a point, Alireza.

626
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:27,605
And what do we do?

627
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:29,397
Legally speaking,

628
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:33,022
if I put the company in my name,

629
00:47:33,188 --> 00:47:36,355
I need a board of directors
of at least four people.

630
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:39,230
I would be the chairman.

631
00:47:39,938 --> 00:47:41,688
You the CEO.

632
00:47:41,855 --> 00:47:44,730
We thought Parviz
could be vice-chairman.

633
00:47:46,188 --> 00:47:47,647
- At your service.
- Thank you.

634
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:51,105
And Farhad
could be an ordinary board member.

635
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:55,230
That's what I had in mind.

636
00:47:55,397 --> 00:47:58,938
Thanks to Mahmoud's advice, of course.

637
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:00,272
My pleasure.

638
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,147
One more!

639
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:04,480
On the count of three, laugh.

640
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:06,230
One, two, three, laugh!

641
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,230
It's a keeper.

642
00:48:14,563 --> 00:48:15,605
Thanks.

643
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:24,605
I'll say it again:
Kick your roommate out.

644
00:48:24,772 --> 00:48:26,438
If he goes down, you go down.

645
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:29,105
As soon as I pay off my debt,
I will.

646
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:33,022
A mere glimpse of your schemes
terrifies me.

647
00:48:33,188 --> 00:48:35,147
I should've gone alone.

648
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:38,855
Had I known you would freak out
and contaminate the others,

649
00:48:39,022 --> 00:48:41,313
I would've kept you out of it.

650
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,730
Call a spade a spade. He's weak.

651
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:47,147
Rejecting your scams
makes him weak and scared?

652
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:50,647
In 8 years at the factory,
he hasn't taken 8 weeks off.

653
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:54,063
If his ex hadn't married the neighbor,
he would've stayed.

654
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,272
What's that got to do with anything?

655
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,022
Save your breath, Leila.

656
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:02,980
Instead of telling us what not to do,

657
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:04,605
tell us what to do.

658
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:08,147
Do anything
except what Manouchehr suggests.

659
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,647
Like the shop, for example.

660
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,563
There you go.

661
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,897
With what money?

662
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:16,438
Said like that,
none of us will find any.

663
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:17,772
How should I say it?

664
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:20,397
Do you only get excited
if it's illegal?

665
00:49:20,563 --> 00:49:23,563
I'm hard enough on myself.
Get off my case.

666
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,355
Don't listen to your moronic brother.

667
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,772
Tell me how much you have.

668
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:31,563
If it's to start a business,

669
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,605
I have about 20 million to contribute.

670
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,897
Farhad, what about you?

671
00:49:37,063 --> 00:49:42,980
If I stop driving and sell the car,
20 million.

672
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,074
Parviz?

673
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:47,230
I swear I have nothing,
except 5 million in debt.

674
00:49:47,397 --> 00:49:49,730
And the money I gave you
last month?

675
00:49:49,897 --> 00:49:51,272
In front of everyone?

676
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:55,647
With that 4 million
I paid off another debt.

677
00:49:56,063 --> 00:49:57,355
How about you, Leila?

678
00:49:57,522 --> 00:50:01,022
I have 8 million,
and half a gold coin from work.

679
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:02,897
What about you, mastermind?

680
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:04,355
800 million.

681
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,813
Nothing, of course! Zilch.

682
00:50:07,188 --> 00:50:08,938
I don't want this.

683
00:50:09,897 --> 00:50:12,188
You want us to leave, is that it?

684
00:50:12,355 --> 00:50:15,730
He wants to have dinner
with his roommate.

685
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:19,147
I can't eat at home
when I'm not in my house clothes.

686
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:20,354
How cute.

687
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:22,855
Go change, instead of being a grump.

688
00:50:23,022 --> 00:50:24,772
For once you have us over.

689
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,522
It's not foolish
to think you could sell your home.

690
00:50:28,813 --> 00:50:29,980
I think it's foolish.

691
00:50:30,313 --> 00:50:32,522
Don't be offended.
How much is it worth?

692
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:35,147
Best case scenario, 120 million.

693
00:50:35,313 --> 00:50:37,397
But there are a lot of obstacles.

694
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:39,105
- What obstacles?
- Lots.

695
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:41,272
- Like what?
- Like the deed.

696
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,730
My roommate, my debt.
Want more?

697
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,563
It's a good time to buy.

698
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,063
It's an investment
that will always retain its value.

699
00:50:50,355 --> 00:50:52,647
Prices keep shooting up.

700
00:50:53,313 --> 00:50:55,938
I examined
all your crummy suggestions

701
00:50:56,105 --> 00:50:59,397
before settling on the deal
I offered you tonight.

702
00:50:59,813 --> 00:51:02,480
You did not.
You've been daydreaming.

703
00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:03,855
What're you driving at?

704
00:51:04,272 --> 00:51:06,438
Don't count on my apartment.

705
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,230
What if we help you
remove the obstacles?

706
00:51:11,522 --> 00:51:14,605
If you don't put this down
to me being stupid,

707
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:19,022
I still harbor the tiny hope
of getting my wife back.

708
00:51:19,605 --> 00:51:20,688
Then what would I do?

709
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:23,605
We'd rent you another place.

710
00:51:24,772 --> 00:51:27,438
I'd rather live in a slum

711
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:29,105
than be a tenant.

712
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:31,272
Didn't you forge my passport

713
00:51:31,438 --> 00:51:33,105
to go hang out in Thailand?

714
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:35,022
You don't need your wife.

715
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:38,105
He doesn't want to give it to us.
Leave him alone.

716
00:51:38,272 --> 00:51:40,855
Are you playing good guy again?

717
00:51:41,022 --> 00:51:44,022
We're a bunch of asses

718
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:47,397
who never learned
not to meddle in people's lives.

719
00:51:51,022 --> 00:51:53,688
If you don't want to be a tenant,
sell this place,

720
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:56,355
we can demolish the house
and build apartments.

721
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,897
Parviz...

722
00:51:58,438 --> 00:52:01,563
the house is falling apart on all sides.

723
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,938
We can't use it to build anything.

724
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:07,605
We're in an urban decay area,
we don't pay taxes.

725
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:10,522
We can build four stories,
with no elevator,

726
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:13,022
and have a 590 sq. ft unit each.

727
00:52:13,188 --> 00:52:15,355
And with an elevator, Mr. Architect?

728
00:52:15,522 --> 00:52:19,188
With an elevator and standard staircase,
430 sq. ft each.

729
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,022
Four units for the four of you.

730
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:25,147
Just bury me and the parents
underneath it all.

731
00:52:25,313 --> 00:52:29,438
Know what? I'll live in the parking lot
with my kids, OK?

732
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,772
Hold on...

733
00:52:32,022 --> 00:52:33,897
What if we take out a loan?

734
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:36,147
We won't get one on the house.

735
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:39,022
Get them out, please.
They're pissing me off.

736
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:43,397
The walls could've collapsed.
We'd all be dead.

737
00:52:43,563 --> 00:52:46,355
Thank God,
you're here, fit as a fiddle

738
00:52:46,522 --> 00:52:48,147
in augmented reality

739
00:52:48,313 --> 00:52:50,022
right before my eyes.

740
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:53,480
Now that you're so elegant,
can you eat?

741
00:52:53,647 --> 00:52:57,855
Elegance is fifteen people
all talking with their mouths full.

742
00:52:58,313 --> 00:53:02,647
How can you let your family
live in that house?

743
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:07,313
You don't care about the family.
You just wanna be a homeowner.

744
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,397
Can you build a house
with no money?

745
00:53:16,063 --> 00:53:18,813
If we have the money,
we might as well buy the shop.

746
00:53:19,147 --> 00:53:20,188
Finally.

747
00:53:20,355 --> 00:53:23,105
He sells his apartment,
we buy the shop...

748
00:53:23,272 --> 00:53:25,105
I got it. You're repeating yourself.

749
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:26,980
Fine, I'll shut up.

750
00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:28,813
I'll think about it.

751
00:53:29,063 --> 00:53:33,605
If it's yes, I'll tell you.
If I say nothing, it's no.

752
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:37,480
Don't eat that,
it's past the use-by date.

753
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:39,855
It's still good to eat.

754
00:53:40,022 --> 00:53:43,355
You won't give us the apartment
or my passport?

755
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:46,980
- I'm talking to you.
- Planning to use it?

756
00:53:47,605 --> 00:53:49,355
Did you hear him?

757
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,730
Stop, give me that.

758
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:56,647
The combination?

759
00:53:56,813 --> 00:53:58,397
I'll ask him.

760
00:54:00,147 --> 00:54:01,897
What the hell are you doing?

761
00:54:02,063 --> 00:54:03,605
Are you out of your mind?

762
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,438
- He'll give it back.
- What's he doing?

763
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:10,855
If we don't get this dump,
he doesn't get my passport!

764
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:13,980
What're you doing?

765
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:16,188
Leave my attaché case alone!

766
00:54:16,355 --> 00:54:17,980
Gimme that!

767
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:19,897
What're you doing with my ID?

768
00:54:20,063 --> 00:54:21,647
It's not in there!

769
00:54:25,438 --> 00:54:27,605
I'll give it to you!

770
00:54:29,897 --> 00:54:32,313
You idiot! Let him give it to you!

771
00:54:33,105 --> 00:54:35,522
Gimme two seconds!

772
00:54:36,397 --> 00:54:37,938
Give me back my documents!

773
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:41,147
Let him open it for you!

774
00:54:41,313 --> 00:54:42,563
Give it back!

775
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,897
Stop it!

776
00:54:44,522 --> 00:54:46,188
Give it back, you big bully!

777
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:48,772
Why're you smashing it?

778
00:54:50,772 --> 00:54:52,563
What're you doing?

779
00:54:53,313 --> 00:54:54,980
Don't do that!

780
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,813
Does he eat them or sell them?

781
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:18,022
Why'd he do that?

782
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:33,980
Can you type this up?

783
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,022
Quiet, she's coming.

784
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:38,355
Sorry to keep you waiting.

785
00:55:39,022 --> 00:55:40,063
Hello.

786
00:55:40,522 --> 00:55:42,897
I presented your case to the board,

787
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:46,980
using Ms. Jourablou's request

788
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:50,438
in the hope of getting
the answer I wanted.

789
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:51,813
In short,

790
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,355
you need to put up 40% of the price

791
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:57,772
and obtain a 4-year loan
to buy the shop.

792
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,730
That gives us...

793
00:56:01,397 --> 00:56:04,897
Our deposit
would have to be 176 million.

794
00:56:07,022 --> 00:56:09,147
Mr. Elias
will see the details with you.

795
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,022
When is the delivery date?

796
00:56:11,397 --> 00:56:12,897
In 7 months.

797
00:56:13,063 --> 00:56:14,480
Construction starts in 3.

798
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,980
Are your documents in order?

799
00:56:19,355 --> 00:56:22,647
No, we need some time to...

800
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:23,897
It won't take long.

801
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,855
Can we have a few days?

802
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,980
You handle it, Ms. Jourablou.

803
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:31,605
Thank you very much.

804
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:32,980
You're welcome.

805
00:56:33,647 --> 00:56:34,647
Thank you very much.

806
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:35,772
Bye.

807
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:37,272
Thanks.

808
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,647
You're welcome.

809
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:53,230
Have a look around,
see if you like it.

810
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:56,313
I'm going to walk around, too.

811
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:19,188
Come look at the fancy shops.

812
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,522
Without a loan,
we'll never get anywhere.

813
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:42,522
Pitch in your apartment.

814
00:57:42,938 --> 00:57:44,272
Farhad, come here.

815
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,772
Give my apartment a rest.
It wouldn't solve your problem.

816
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:53,438
- We did the numbers.
- Yeah, but there's a hitch.

817
00:57:53,605 --> 00:57:56,313
I can only get 50,000 for my place.

818
00:57:56,813 --> 00:58:00,772
By pooling our money,
we only have 100, and we need 180.

819
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:03,605
What's the hitch?

820
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,897
I have debts, nothing serious.

821
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:11,772
What's wrong? You don't look well.

822
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:24,897
Mehrnaz took a third of the apartment
for alimony.

823
00:58:28,313 --> 00:58:30,855
- For alimony?
- Yes.

824
00:58:32,938 --> 00:58:35,147
You divorced?

825
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:39,230
Two months ago.

826
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:43,647
Here.

827
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,647
All done?

828
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:48,688
I'm gonna gobble you up.

829
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,438
- Parviz?
- Yes.

830
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,397
How are you?

831
00:58:56,355 --> 00:58:57,772
Good to see you.

832
00:58:58,313 --> 00:59:00,063
How are things?

833
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,647
Hello, young ladies.

834
00:59:01,813 --> 00:59:04,397
Look how beautiful they are.

835
00:59:04,436 --> 00:59:05,490
You OK?

836
00:59:05,522 --> 00:59:07,355
Sorry, went down the wrong way.

837
00:59:07,522 --> 00:59:09,188
You never stop by.

838
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:10,897
I'm busy, as you see.

839
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:13,355
God be with you.
Is your father home?

840
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:14,647
My father?

841
00:59:14,938 --> 00:59:16,230
You want to see him?

842
00:59:16,855 --> 00:59:18,938
He must be home.

843
00:59:46,063 --> 00:59:47,313
Put them here.

844
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:50,480
You should come inside, Esmail.

845
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:51,855
We'll be outside.

846
00:59:52,397 --> 00:59:54,563
- Is the barbecue ready?
- Yes.

847
00:59:54,897 --> 00:59:56,105
Jafar...

848
00:59:56,272 --> 00:59:57,980
- Brew some tea.
- Alright.

849
00:59:58,772 --> 01:00:02,730
Get everyone out,
we need some time alone.

850
01:00:02,897 --> 01:00:04,105
Will do.

851
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:10,022
Ehsan, sister, go on.
I'll finish up.

852
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,813
Why does your family
keep saying we hooked you on opium?

853
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:19,147
It's jealousy.
We get along, so people talk.

854
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:23,313
Not one of your sons
came to Gholam's memorial.

855
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,688
I'm sorry.

856
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,772
That's all you can say.

857
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,522
Jafar, bring the card.

858
01:00:29,813 --> 01:00:30,980
Listen, Cousin...

859
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:37,813
A lot of people would love
to be named patriarch of the family.

860
01:00:38,938 --> 01:00:41,688
At my son's wedding,
Gholam's only grandson,

861
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,480
we'll officially name a successor.

862
01:00:44,063 --> 01:00:45,813
Who would you choose?

863
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,272
Ghardashali, of course.

864
01:00:47,855 --> 01:00:49,230
He's a gambler.

865
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:52,647
His bad reputation
ultimately rubbed off on my father.

866
01:00:53,188 --> 01:00:55,105
True, but we have no choice.

867
01:00:55,438 --> 01:00:59,272
In his will, my father named you.

868
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:01,563
Me?

869
01:01:02,313 --> 01:01:03,522
Why?

870
01:01:04,022 --> 01:01:07,147
You're the eldest
and you've always been loyal.

871
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:08,897
That lot you gave him,

872
01:01:09,063 --> 01:01:10,772
he talked about it all the time.

873
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:12,355
It was my duty.

874
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:15,438
Which is why
you deserve to be patriarch.

875
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,188
Everyone will kowtow to you.

876
01:01:18,272 --> 01:01:20,063
I mean no disrespect,

877
01:01:20,397 --> 01:01:23,188
but do you have the shoulders
to sit in Gholam's place?

878
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,147
I assure you I don't.

879
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:26,980
You'll have to.

880
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:30,813
Give me a straight answer:

881
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:32,272
yes or no?

882
01:01:32,813 --> 01:01:34,313
Yes, of course.

883
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:36,813
You feel up to it?

884
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,272
I'm no great like you,
but I can emulate you.

885
01:01:40,438 --> 01:01:42,730
At the wedding,
you'll give the biggest gift.

886
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:44,772
Do you have the means?

887
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:46,772
I would do anything for you.

888
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:48,897
You know the rules?

889
01:01:49,063 --> 01:01:52,022
The gift can only be cash or...

890
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:53,980
Gold coins.

891
01:01:54,147 --> 01:01:55,272
Do you have the money?

892
01:01:55,688 --> 01:01:57,522
- I'll find it.
- No.

893
01:01:57,688 --> 01:01:59,855
You have it or you'll find it?

894
01:02:00,355 --> 01:02:01,355
I have it.

895
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:03,855
You have to sign before a notary.

896
01:02:04,105 --> 01:02:05,480
With pleasure.

897
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:07,522
I'm counting on that money.

898
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:09,813
If you don't have it,
I'll ask someone else.

899
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:12,355
On my Gholam's life I have it.

900
01:02:12,688 --> 01:02:13,688
Your Gholam?

901
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,772
Parviz just had a boy.

902
01:02:15,938 --> 01:02:18,355
We named him Gholam
in honor of your father.

903
01:02:21,522 --> 01:02:23,105
I've always said it,

904
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:26,313
you're the most decent man
in this family.

905
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,563
Here,

906
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:30,355
the list of gifts patriarchs have given

907
01:02:30,522 --> 01:02:32,022
over the past 20 years.

908
01:02:32,188 --> 01:02:35,980
It goes up with each new wedding.

909
01:02:36,272 --> 01:02:41,438
I don't know what I've done
to deserve such an honor.

910
01:02:42,813 --> 01:02:44,022
You deserve it, Cousin.

911
01:02:45,605 --> 01:02:46,813
You deserve it.

912
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,938
I should be kissing
the ground you walk on.

913
01:03:00,022 --> 01:03:02,897
Why repeat
what your shrew of a daughter says?

914
01:03:03,063 --> 01:03:05,313
How can you become patriarch?

915
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,647
With the money she confiscated.

916
01:03:07,673 --> 01:03:08,706
How much is that?

917
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,938
Enough to become patriarch.

918
01:03:11,105 --> 01:03:14,022
You had the foresight to save up?

919
01:03:14,313 --> 01:03:17,438
Wouldn't you like us
to be patriarch and matriarch?

920
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:21,397
Have everyone stand up
when we walk in a room?

921
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:25,272
Will I be treated with great pomp
at Bayram's son's wedding?

922
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:26,730
Of course!

923
01:03:26,897 --> 01:03:30,813
The day of the wedding,
they'll deliver our outfits.

924
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:34,313
You'll be sitting next to the bride,

925
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,688
and I'll sit next to the groom.

926
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:40,480
The bride will ask for your permission
to say "I do."

927
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,563
What if she doesn't and humiliates me?

928
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,522
She can't, it's the law.

929
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,147
I can't see those people
treating us that well.

930
01:03:49,605 --> 01:03:51,272
That's nothing.

931
01:03:51,438 --> 01:03:56,188
When I die, the announcement will read:
"Patriarch of the Jourablou Clan."

932
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:59,605
And for you, it'll read,

933
01:03:59,772 --> 01:04:02,355
"Wife of the Patriarch
of the Jourablou Clan."

934
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,355
They didn't even use to say hello.

935
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:07,897
Why would they make you this offer?

936
01:04:08,438 --> 01:04:10,480
First of all, I'm the eldest.

937
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:12,522
Second of all,
it was in Gholam's will.

938
01:04:12,855 --> 01:04:14,772
He named you in his will?

939
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:16,813
I'm telling you!

940
01:04:17,105 --> 01:04:20,438
Teach your children
to respect the family.

941
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:25,522
You know what will change for us,
if I become patriarch.

942
01:04:25,897 --> 01:04:29,688
And what it'll change for the others!

943
01:04:33,438 --> 01:04:34,438
Farhad...

944
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:37,688
What?

945
01:04:38,313 --> 01:04:42,605
Dad's decided to impress Bayram
at his son's wedding.

946
01:04:42,772 --> 01:04:46,230
Promising. Just what we needed!

947
01:04:51,772 --> 01:04:54,522
What're you and your husband
up to again?

948
01:04:54,688 --> 01:04:57,688
- Isn't my husband your father?
- That's for you to say.

949
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,855
Dad, what's up?

950
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:03,980
We're invited to the wedding.
I'm being named patriarch.

951
01:05:05,938 --> 01:05:07,647
We're screwed. He's loving this.

952
01:05:07,813 --> 01:05:10,272
Don't you like being respected?

953
01:05:10,438 --> 01:05:12,063
Nobody dislikes it.

954
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:14,772
But isn't this sudden respect
suspicious?

955
01:05:15,188 --> 01:05:19,230
Do you know Gholam
paid the mortgage on this house?

956
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:25,480
How can you tell such huge lies
to your own detriment?

957
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:28,522
The more they disdain you,
the more you idolize them.

958
01:05:28,897 --> 01:05:30,647
What have they ever done for you?

959
01:05:30,813 --> 01:05:34,355
They made a junky of you at 70
to steal your inheritance!

960
01:05:34,522 --> 01:05:35,980
Don't be ridiculous.

961
01:05:36,147 --> 01:05:38,188
For two acres of arid land...

962
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:41,230
That're worth 100 million today!

963
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:47,105
Gholam and Bayram
spent ten times more on me by the sea.

964
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,897
You want to talk me out of it?

965
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:52,897
What kind of a phone call was that?

966
01:05:53,063 --> 01:05:55,605
I'm going out of my mind.

967
01:05:55,772 --> 01:05:57,688
Dad's invited to the wedding

968
01:05:57,855 --> 01:06:00,730
as patriarch,
so he's giving the first gift,

969
01:06:00,897 --> 01:06:02,563
the most expensive one.

970
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,980
- He can just give a small one.
- He can't.

971
01:06:06,147 --> 01:06:10,063
The patriarch's gift
has to be the biggest.

972
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:14,188
If he gives a small one,
the others will be tiny.

973
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,647
Think of the hosts.

974
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,800
Alireza,

975
01:06:17,813 --> 01:06:19,563
when I got married,

976
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,272
I was humiliated

977
01:06:21,438 --> 01:06:23,480
by those asshole cousins of his.

978
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:24,980
Shame on you.

979
01:06:26,813 --> 01:06:29,355
What about the coins Gholam gave you?

980
01:06:29,522 --> 01:06:32,105
How can you say that in front of us?

981
01:06:32,272 --> 01:06:34,813
Gholam didn't even want to come
to his wedding!

982
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,022
Dad had to buy 5 coins on credit.

983
01:06:38,188 --> 01:06:41,730
Gholam deigned to come gift them
as if he were generous.

984
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:46,188
That wedding
was the worst night of my life!

985
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:49,563
We expected 300 guests,
there weren't 50.

986
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:52,813
At 1 a.m., people were leaving
and I was still hoping

987
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,105
your relatives would show up.

988
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:58,522
I have a list of the gifts exchanged
these past 20 years.

989
01:06:58,688 --> 01:07:01,397
This notebook
holds proof of their ploys.

990
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,688
How much was Gholam's last gift?

991
01:07:03,855 --> 01:07:06,105
For his granddaughter, 30.

992
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,272
This time, Bayram,
the groom's father, is giving 35.

993
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,647
So they expect Dad to pay 40!

994
01:07:11,813 --> 01:07:13,188
40 what?

995
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:14,813
40 gold coins?

996
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,438
Everything's bogus,
the bride's name, the gifts...

997
01:07:18,605 --> 01:07:20,605
Why should we give them real gold?

998
01:07:20,772 --> 01:07:23,397
You're losing your marbles.

999
01:07:23,563 --> 01:07:26,105
There were one or two missteps.

1000
01:07:26,397 --> 01:07:29,397
Bayram doesn't have enough
to throw a wedding.

1001
01:07:29,563 --> 01:07:30,938
That's why he's come to you.

1002
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:34,605
He came out of respect
for our traditions.

1003
01:07:34,772 --> 01:07:37,980
I am both the eldest
and the chosen one.

1004
01:07:38,147 --> 01:07:39,272
Stop bothering me.

1005
01:07:39,438 --> 01:07:41,688
Dig your head out of the sand.

1006
01:07:41,855 --> 01:07:45,772
You know the first gift's a set up.

1007
01:07:45,938 --> 01:07:48,438
No millionaire gives as big a gift

1008
01:07:48,605 --> 01:07:50,105
as our dirt-poor patriarch.

1009
01:07:50,272 --> 01:07:51,354
Mom.

1010
01:07:51,355 --> 01:07:54,147
How did he get you
to shut up about this?

1011
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:56,938
Her? She thinks she's a queen now.

1012
01:07:57,105 --> 01:07:58,147
Tell me, my queen!

1013
01:07:58,313 --> 01:08:02,397
Haven't you spent your life
talking behind his family's back?

1014
01:08:02,563 --> 01:08:05,522
You've always wanted
to cut off all ties.

1015
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:09,188
They've changed, that's all!

1016
01:08:09,563 --> 01:08:13,063
They've always benefited
from mistreating people.

1017
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,022
They'll never change!

1018
01:08:15,188 --> 01:08:18,105
At every wedding,
Gholam would take a dozen coins,

1019
01:08:18,272 --> 01:08:21,397
pocket 5
and give the rest as a gift.

1020
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,313
And everyone was happy to see him.

1021
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,688
There!
He knows what he's saying!

1022
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:28,480
Ask them to lend you 40 coins

1023
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:32,272
and give them back
while passing for the highest bidder.

1024
01:08:33,897 --> 01:08:35,188
What're you doing?

1025
01:08:35,772 --> 01:08:37,480
Are you running away?

1026
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,063
Don't be so hard. Think of his heart.

1027
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,480
Step aside.

1028
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:42,855
Alireza, son...

1029
01:08:43,022 --> 01:08:44,188
Let them talk.

1030
01:08:44,355 --> 01:08:45,730
Can we have an answer?

1031
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:50,188
If they wanted to foot the bill,
they wouldn't have opened the door.

1032
01:08:50,355 --> 01:08:51,938
You know and you're going?

1033
01:08:52,105 --> 01:08:55,522
It won't work with Bayram,
but it will with future weddings.

1034
01:08:56,188 --> 01:08:58,855
The rest of my life,
I'll pocket a percentage

1035
01:08:59,022 --> 01:09:01,105
and give them the rest.

1036
01:09:01,272 --> 01:09:04,063
Everyone knows it's a scam

1037
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,855
but they gladly take part in it?

1038
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:08,605
Yes, it's a cycle.

1039
01:09:08,772 --> 01:09:11,480
They know they'll have their turn.

1040
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,730
It's always been.

1041
01:09:12,897 --> 01:09:17,313
With all the weddings planned,
if Dad's smart, he'll make some dough.

1042
01:09:17,897 --> 01:09:21,147
You're dumb enough
to think he's smart?

1043
01:09:21,313 --> 01:09:24,438
Of course I'm smart.
I'm just as good as they are.

1044
01:09:24,605 --> 01:09:27,230
I took the bus to work for 37 years.

1045
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,647
Proof you're not so smart.

1046
01:09:29,813 --> 01:09:32,230
You slaved away your whole life.

1047
01:09:32,397 --> 01:09:34,605
You were never a freeloader.

1048
01:09:34,772 --> 01:09:38,230
Every time they show up in our lives,
they bring trouble.

1049
01:09:38,397 --> 01:09:40,480
We can't give you the money.

1050
01:09:40,647 --> 01:09:43,105
We're starting a business.

1051
01:09:43,438 --> 01:09:46,647
- Whose money were you counting on?
- Mine!

1052
01:09:46,813 --> 01:09:48,605
- What do you have?
- Gold coins!

1053
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:50,688
- How many?
- 40!

1054
01:09:50,855 --> 01:09:52,022
You tell them!

1055
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:56,313
He's delirious. It's withdrawal.
Go get your hit.

1056
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,938
What's he talking about, Leila?

1057
01:09:58,563 --> 01:10:01,855
It's true.
That's why I called you.

1058
01:10:02,022 --> 01:10:03,063
How many does he have?

1059
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,563
40.

1060
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,188
40 coins.

1061
01:10:07,813 --> 01:10:09,730
Where'd you get them?

1062
01:10:09,757 --> 01:10:10,830
I had them.

1063
01:10:10,855 --> 01:10:13,480
You had 40 coins and we didn't know?

1064
01:10:13,813 --> 01:10:15,522
You'd have taken them.

1065
01:10:15,688 --> 01:10:16,730
Really?

1066
01:10:17,022 --> 01:10:19,063
You've watched us struggle

1067
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:20,397
without saying anything?

1068
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:23,647
It was my nest egg, for a rainy day.

1069
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,813
Every day is a rainy day!

1070
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,897
Leila, how much more
do we need for the shop?

1071
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:29,772
60 million.

1072
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:31,272
- Manouchehr?
- That's correct.

1073
01:10:31,438 --> 01:10:33,063
Parviz, Farhad...

1074
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,647
See, Dad?

1075
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:37,772
With your coins,
we could buy that shop.

1076
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:40,438
You all talk, but you don't listen!

1077
01:10:40,605 --> 01:10:44,147
And that way, we'd all have jobs.

1078
01:10:44,313 --> 01:10:47,438
All our problems would be solved.

1079
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,897
We could start our own families.

1080
01:10:52,063 --> 01:10:54,647
And you would be our patriarch.

1081
01:10:54,813 --> 01:10:56,272
All with a single shop.

1082
01:10:56,813 --> 01:10:58,397
These coins aren't for a shop.

1083
01:10:58,563 --> 01:11:01,313
They're for a wedding
I'm the patriarch of.

1084
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,438
Dad...

1085
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:04,188
Leave me alone!

1086
01:11:04,355 --> 01:11:06,688
If you're not happy, get out!

1087
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:08,772
- Excuse me?
- Give me that!

1088
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:09,818
What do I do?

1089
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:11,355
They're mine!
Don't ask him!

1090
01:11:11,522 --> 01:11:13,022
Hand them over!

1091
01:11:13,188 --> 01:11:15,688
Here. Do you hear yourself?

1092
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,355
Ghardashali would give anything
to be in my shoes.

1093
01:11:18,382 --> 01:11:19,502
Because he's dumb!

1094
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:21,313
I'm dumber than he is!

1095
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,938
Money comes and goes.

1096
01:11:23,105 --> 01:11:25,313
Your dad dreams of being honored

1097
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,022
for once in his life.

1098
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:29,438
Mom,

1099
01:11:29,605 --> 01:11:32,980
your four sons are unemployed.

1100
01:11:33,147 --> 01:11:35,980
They dream of having stable jobs.

1101
01:11:36,007 --> 01:11:37,087
Dad,

1102
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:40,105
your sons have no money,

1103
01:11:40,272 --> 01:11:41,563
no health insurance,

1104
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,688
and no hope
of one day having a pension.

1105
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:47,355
Dad...

1106
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:49,980
Dad.

1107
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:52,355
Look at me.

1108
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:54,355
Daddy dearest,

1109
01:11:54,813 --> 01:11:57,105
you know what I'm afraid of?

1110
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:59,188
Don't take this badly.

1111
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,188
I'm afraid that,
if we give them 40 coins,

1112
01:12:03,438 --> 01:12:07,647
they'll say the coins were theirs.

1113
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:10,897
Everyone will believe them.

1114
01:12:11,813 --> 01:12:13,438
You know why?

1115
01:12:13,938 --> 01:12:18,938
Because we don't look like we can give
40 coins or 50 million.

1116
01:12:19,105 --> 01:12:21,855
We're just too poor.

1117
01:12:22,813 --> 01:12:24,230
Really.

1118
01:12:25,063 --> 01:12:27,022
He's right.

1119
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:32,397
We'd be better off
renting out our suits,

1120
01:12:32,897 --> 01:12:37,147
than giving a gift that's so pricey
we'll be suspected and ridiculed.

1121
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:40,105
I don't want to argue with you.

1122
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:42,897
But they're leading you
up the garden path.

1123
01:12:43,563 --> 01:12:45,063
That path is a street.

1124
01:12:45,813 --> 01:12:47,188
An avenue.

1125
01:12:47,355 --> 01:12:48,522
A boulevard,

1126
01:12:49,105 --> 01:12:50,605
a royal boulevard.

1127
01:13:02,063 --> 01:13:03,188
Oh, my goodness!

1128
01:13:03,355 --> 01:13:04,522
Dad!

1129
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,522
Get him up.

1130
01:13:06,772 --> 01:13:08,355
Alireza, Farhad...

1131
01:13:08,522 --> 01:13:09,938
Calm down.

1132
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,938
Dad...

1133
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:13,730
Is he breathing?

1134
01:13:14,313 --> 01:13:15,563
Daddy dearest.

1135
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:20,730
Wait over there.
The IV will be finished 30 minutes.

1136
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,772
The IV will be finished in 30 minutes.

1137
01:13:33,272 --> 01:13:36,147
Did you know Dad's never been
by the sea?

1138
01:13:36,313 --> 01:13:38,647
He said he went with Gholam...

1139
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:40,855
A pack of lies.

1140
01:13:41,022 --> 01:13:43,605
They never took him.

1141
01:13:43,772 --> 01:13:47,730
When you can't feed your family,
you don't go on weekend getaways!

1142
01:13:48,272 --> 01:13:52,147
He makes up memories
with his cousins

1143
01:13:52,313 --> 01:13:54,063
to prove that they love him.

1144
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:57,313
For that bastard Bayram's wedding,

1145
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,355
Dad dry-cleaned his suit
a month in advance.

1146
01:14:01,522 --> 01:14:04,688
He checked the mail every day
for the invite.

1147
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:06,563
It never came.

1148
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:08,147
He never went.

1149
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:12,605
But he's shared a thousand memories
of that wedding.

1150
01:14:13,272 --> 01:14:18,605
He even says I was there,
and uses me as a witness.

1151
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:24,063
Being their guest of honor
means the world to him.

1152
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:26,438
So leave him alone.

1153
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,522
Let him do what he wants.

1154
01:14:31,563 --> 01:14:35,897
He tried so hard to get their attention
that he got their pity.

1155
01:14:36,063 --> 01:14:37,772
Not even.

1156
01:14:37,938 --> 01:14:42,272
When that bastard Gholam was alive,
he wouldn't give him time of day.

1157
01:14:42,438 --> 01:14:46,397
Now they expect us to believe
he named him in his will?

1158
01:14:47,022 --> 01:14:49,688
I don't think there is a will.

1159
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:52,772
And if there is, it means

1160
01:14:52,938 --> 01:14:56,522
we're letting a dead man
dictate our lives.

1161
01:15:29,605 --> 01:15:31,688
What's gotten into you?

1162
01:16:20,063 --> 01:16:21,813
What're you doing?

1163
01:16:23,938 --> 01:16:26,188
The dishes can wait.

1164
01:16:26,355 --> 01:16:28,855
I'm cleaning your father's piss.

1165
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,688
That's what you get
for sneaking a smoke.

1166
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,980
Who're you talking to?

1167
01:16:36,147 --> 01:16:38,230
Don't you mind
seeing your sister smoke?

1168
01:16:39,063 --> 01:16:40,730
Didn't your brothers mind

1169
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:43,647
seeing you 6 months pregnant
at your wedding?

1170
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:46,897
Alireza,
aren't you going to scold that hussy?

1171
01:16:47,272 --> 01:16:50,397
You're the one who was pregnant,
not her.

1172
01:17:12,147 --> 01:17:15,230
I don't know what to do anymore.

1173
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,563
Don't worry.

1174
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:20,730
Things can get worse than this here.
Then you forget.

1175
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,563
For me?

1176
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:32,980
I don't smoke.

1177
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:33,987
Take it.

1178
01:17:34,022 --> 01:17:37,022
Smoke rarely and quit when you can.

1179
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,730
You alright?

1180
01:17:51,522 --> 01:17:52,522
I'm OK.

1181
01:17:52,772 --> 01:17:53,772
Are you sure?

1182
01:17:54,272 --> 01:17:55,272
Yes.

1183
01:17:55,397 --> 01:17:56,563
Are you lying?

1184
01:17:56,855 --> 01:17:58,063
Yes.

1185
01:18:01,397 --> 01:18:02,813
Don't worry.

1186
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:06,480
Only when you hit rock bottom
do you learn how to get up.

1187
01:18:09,438 --> 01:18:11,688
Good thing you don't smoke.

1188
01:18:17,938 --> 01:18:19,605
You think Oshin's still alive?

1189
01:18:20,438 --> 01:18:21,730
Wanna get in touch?

1190
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:24,938
If it wasn't for that TV show,

1191
01:18:25,105 --> 01:18:28,688
we'd never have known
we had to endure our miserable lives.

1192
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:31,647
We don't endure them,
we improve them.

1193
01:18:32,063 --> 01:18:36,022
Even Oshin, with her thrift store,
improved their lives.

1194
01:18:36,272 --> 01:18:38,105
My brothers are a bunch of losers.

1195
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,132
Why?

1196
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:41,063
Even a thrift store's too much to ask.

1197
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:42,438
True!

1198
01:18:52,105 --> 01:18:55,938
I still don't understand
how we sank so low.

1199
01:18:56,605 --> 01:19:00,313
It's not at all the future
I envisioned as a kid.

1200
01:19:01,813 --> 01:19:07,105
I've learned that growing up
means slowly but surely

1201
01:19:07,355 --> 01:19:10,938
giving up on what you want.

1202
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:17,438
Did you know that all the rich people
know each other?

1203
01:19:17,605 --> 01:19:19,355
I see it at work.

1204
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:20,522
Why?

1205
01:19:21,897 --> 01:19:23,397
There aren't many of them.

1206
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:28,105
Poor people don't know each other,
they recognize each other.

1207
01:19:30,438 --> 01:19:32,522
I don't know. Maybe.

1208
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,938
You had a suitor who disappeared...

1209
01:19:38,855 --> 01:19:40,813
- Majid.
- Yeah.

1210
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,647
Did you know he got divorced?

1211
01:19:43,188 --> 01:19:44,605
So what?

1212
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,730
Do you still like him?

1213
01:19:48,355 --> 01:19:50,397
I'd forgotten he existed.

1214
01:19:50,563 --> 01:19:52,480
Thank God.

1215
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,062
Why?

1216
01:19:54,063 --> 01:19:56,522
He just married his second wife.

1217
01:19:58,147 --> 01:19:59,730
Third time's the charm.

1218
01:19:59,897 --> 01:20:01,647
He'll come after me next.

1219
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,105
Practice makes perfect.

1220
01:20:07,105 --> 01:20:09,313
Why'd he disappear all of a sudden?

1221
01:20:09,647 --> 01:20:12,605
Dad told him I had an illness.

1222
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,355
Who told you?

1223
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:15,647
Majid did.

1224
01:20:15,772 --> 01:20:16,812
When?

1225
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,272
After his divorce.

1226
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,897
You're still in touch?

1227
01:20:20,063 --> 01:20:23,147
He called me once
to suggest we get together.

1228
01:20:23,313 --> 01:20:24,313
I said no.

1229
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:32,938
Why would Dad say such a thing?

1230
01:20:33,855 --> 01:20:36,438
He wanted me to marry
someone from his family.

1231
01:20:36,605 --> 01:20:37,605
Did you want to?

1232
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:40,772
I never got a chance to give my opinion.

1233
01:20:41,355 --> 01:20:42,522
What do you mean?

1234
01:20:42,897 --> 01:20:48,563
Dad tried to charm them
into sending a suitor to marry me.

1235
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:51,188
None of them wanted me.

1236
01:20:56,855 --> 01:20:59,605
What can I do
to help pull us out of this?

1237
01:21:04,355 --> 01:21:05,522
Have a magic lantern?

1238
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,938
Suppose I did.

1239
01:21:09,813 --> 01:21:12,022
Give me a sister.

1240
01:21:12,188 --> 01:21:15,855
An older one, that I can lean on.

1241
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:18,855
And?

1242
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,563
And...

1243
01:21:21,397 --> 01:21:25,647
Take Manouchehr back to his school days,
when he was so smart.

1244
01:21:26,777 --> 01:21:27,830
Is that all?

1245
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:31,397
Make us forget this period
with the wave of a magic wand.

1246
01:21:31,772 --> 01:21:33,355
Me or the magic lantern?

1247
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:34,813
If only you could.

1248
01:21:35,147 --> 01:21:37,147
If I could...

1249
01:21:39,313 --> 01:21:42,355
I'd buy a shop for each of us.

1250
01:21:43,772 --> 01:21:45,813
And I'd make Dad our patriarch.

1251
01:21:46,188 --> 01:21:48,147
Luckily, your wishes can come true.

1252
01:21:48,522 --> 01:21:49,522
How?

1253
01:21:49,647 --> 01:21:53,147
We stop Dad from going to the wedding
and we buy the shop.

1254
01:21:53,438 --> 01:21:55,230
Have you lost your mind?

1255
01:21:55,897 --> 01:21:58,397
He just got out of the hospital.

1256
01:21:58,563 --> 01:22:00,980
He passed out for real, this time.

1257
01:22:01,147 --> 01:22:03,188
I don't believe it.

1258
01:22:03,355 --> 01:22:06,438
You want him to give them the coins
at the wedding?

1259
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:09,480
I want nothing.
I'm saying they're his to give.

1260
01:22:10,022 --> 01:22:13,147
It's either the wedding or the shop.

1261
01:22:13,313 --> 01:22:15,397
It's his life or his death.

1262
01:22:15,688 --> 01:22:19,730
Another fight like that one
and he's sure to have a heart attack.

1263
01:22:19,897 --> 01:22:21,563
And you'll take care of him.

1264
01:22:22,147 --> 01:22:23,313
Drop it, Leila.

1265
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,688
I can't drop it.
And you have no right to!

1266
01:22:27,063 --> 01:22:29,647
I agree that it's a poor decision.

1267
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:32,855
But poor decision-making
is what he does.

1268
01:22:33,188 --> 01:22:34,563
He's like a stubborn kid.

1269
01:22:35,022 --> 01:22:37,188
That's all we have in this family.

1270
01:22:37,355 --> 01:22:40,313
Even the old folks are stubborn kids.

1271
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,897
If we pressure him, he'll die.

1272
01:22:42,855 --> 01:22:44,188
Is that your final word?

1273
01:22:44,355 --> 01:22:46,272
It was also my first.

1274
01:22:46,897 --> 01:22:49,063
We're all free to do as we please.

1275
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:52,105
We're all responsible for our own lives.

1276
01:22:52,272 --> 01:22:57,063
No one has the right to whine their way
into other people's lives.

1277
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:59,647
Are you saying that for me?

1278
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,938
Am I whining for myself?

1279
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:05,022
I asked you to stay to help me.

1280
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:09,272
If I stick around,
you'll have to listen to me.

1281
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,980
If you act like the others I'll leave.

1282
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:27,230
Mom!

1283
01:23:27,397 --> 01:23:30,730
Heat up my lunch.
I've got a ride, I'm late.

1284
01:23:45,105 --> 01:23:46,313
You were out Saturday.

1285
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,980
I was looking for work.

1286
01:23:48,147 --> 01:23:50,480
You'll lose your benefits next time.

1287
01:23:51,022 --> 01:23:52,147
Yes, sir.

1288
01:23:52,313 --> 01:23:53,480
Let me see your ID.

1289
01:24:00,772 --> 01:24:04,105
Ali! Careful not to fall again.

1290
01:24:06,522 --> 01:24:09,272
Hurry up, Mommy. It's started.

1291
01:24:10,897 --> 01:24:11,897
Come on!

1292
01:24:16,105 --> 01:24:17,105
Hello.

1293
01:24:53,897 --> 01:24:56,063
Dad, get outta there!

1294
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:57,159
What's that?

1295
01:24:57,188 --> 01:24:59,147
Bayram sent it for Dad.

1296
01:24:59,772 --> 01:25:01,688
There's no water again!

1297
01:25:01,855 --> 01:25:06,355
Mom, Leila, shut off the water.
We're all waiting to use the shower.

1298
01:25:06,522 --> 01:25:07,562
Alireza?

1299
01:25:07,563 --> 01:25:09,980
Beautiful! Is that for me?

1300
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,229
It sure is.

1301
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,730
Classy.

1302
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:16,272
The shirt I promised you.
Super XL!

1303
01:25:16,563 --> 01:25:18,980
Thanks very much, little brother!

1304
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,813
These shoes go well with that suit.

1305
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:22,980
Thank you, Manouchehr.

1306
01:25:23,147 --> 01:25:24,438
Don't mention it.

1307
01:25:24,605 --> 01:25:26,730
These watches are fake,
but they work.

1308
01:25:26,897 --> 01:25:29,688
- Here, Parviz. Take one.
- Thanks.

1309
01:25:29,855 --> 01:25:32,563
Solid gold brothers!

1310
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:34,022
- Manou-junk?
- Yes.

1311
01:25:34,188 --> 01:25:35,772
Can I take this?

1312
01:25:36,355 --> 01:25:37,438
I've worn it once.

1313
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:39,230
I don't mind. I like it.

1314
01:25:39,397 --> 01:25:40,479
Take it.

1315
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,313
Parviz, I took out the insoles,
they should fit.

1316
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,022
Thank you.

1317
01:25:45,855 --> 01:25:48,647
Look at that peachy complexion!

1318
01:25:48,813 --> 01:25:50,855
Peach or tomato?

1319
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:56,397
Neither peach nor tomato.
That's my little duckling.

1320
01:25:56,563 --> 01:25:59,105
I'm going to eat that little duckling.

1321
01:25:59,272 --> 01:26:01,105
You're handsome, Daddy dearest.

1322
01:26:01,272 --> 01:26:03,522
A true newlywed.

1323
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,480
If you say so.

1324
01:26:05,647 --> 01:26:08,563
I hope that this year,
we can all go together

1325
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,730
to the beautiful beaches in Pattaya.

1326
01:26:10,897 --> 01:26:12,938
I'm counting on you.

1327
01:26:13,105 --> 01:26:16,147
- Got the coins from Leila?
- She's gift-wrapping the box.

1328
01:26:16,313 --> 01:26:18,897
Make sure she wraps it beautifully.

1329
01:26:19,063 --> 01:26:19,813
She will.

1330
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:22,480
Dad, Bayram sent you this.

1331
01:26:22,647 --> 01:26:23,730
Fantastic.

1332
01:26:23,897 --> 01:26:26,188
Alireza, can I go next?

1333
01:26:26,355 --> 01:26:28,063
Yeah, don't take 3 hours.

1334
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,076
I'll make it quick.

1335
01:26:29,105 --> 01:26:31,980
A suit paid for by Bayram

1336
01:26:32,147 --> 01:26:34,522
is something else.

1337
01:27:06,605 --> 01:27:10,147
Look how handsome they are!
May God keep you.

1338
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:11,897
Pray.

1339
01:27:12,063 --> 01:27:14,647
Stop it, Mom. That's Parviz's meal.

1340
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:22,105
Let me take your picture.

1341
01:27:22,272 --> 01:27:23,980
Mom, go stand next to him.

1342
01:27:24,147 --> 01:27:26,063
Manouchehr, next to Alireza.

1343
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:28,147
Farhad, on this side. You're taller.

1344
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:29,219
Careful.

1345
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:31,230
I am. Line up.
Parviz, step forward.

1346
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,563
Come on, line up properly.

1347
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:36,230
I am being careful.

1348
01:27:36,397 --> 01:27:37,437
Now.

1349
01:27:37,438 --> 01:27:38,438
Look at me.

1350
01:27:38,605 --> 01:27:39,605
Very nice.

1351
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:40,730
More to the left.

1352
01:27:42,855 --> 01:27:44,855
I don't want the bathroom door.

1353
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:46,312
More...

1354
01:27:46,313 --> 01:27:47,355
Good.

1355
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,355
One... Smile.

1356
01:27:50,022 --> 01:27:51,272
Two...

1357
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:54,980
My sweethearts, you're gorgeous.

1358
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:57,355
Three.

1359
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:00,772
All done?

1360
01:28:02,897 --> 01:28:03,937
Leila,

1361
01:28:03,938 --> 01:28:06,980
Dad's all dressed up.
Take a picture of him alone.

1362
01:28:07,563 --> 01:28:09,022
Take one of us two first.

1363
01:28:09,813 --> 01:28:12,188
Parviz, out of the way.
I want him alone.

1364
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:13,980
Why? They look nice together.

1365
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,397
He doesn't have a nice portrait.

1366
01:28:16,563 --> 01:28:18,105
Contradicting me again?

1367
01:28:18,272 --> 01:28:20,522
What do you want a portrait for?

1368
01:28:20,688 --> 01:28:21,688
Go on then.

1369
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:25,980
We never know what might happen.

1370
01:28:27,022 --> 01:28:28,355
It's for his funeral.

1371
01:28:28,522 --> 01:28:31,438
Dad, come stand over here.

1372
01:28:32,522 --> 01:28:34,022
Farhad, sit to pee!

1373
01:28:34,355 --> 01:28:36,397
Don't, it's a bad omen.

1374
01:28:36,915 --> 01:28:37,962
Don't take it.

1375
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,772
Death comes when it's ready.
Take one of me, too.

1376
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,647
Give us a break.

1377
01:28:42,813 --> 01:28:44,688
We can't use your picture.

1378
01:28:44,855 --> 01:28:46,480
We'll have to use a flower!
Move.

1379
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:51,313
Leila, take it.
Tonight's photo is different.

1380
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:21,897
Dad, should I hold it for you?

1381
01:29:22,355 --> 01:29:25,355
Give it to Bayram when it's gift time.

1382
01:29:25,855 --> 01:29:26,897
OK.

1383
01:29:29,563 --> 01:29:30,563
Alireza?

1384
01:29:31,188 --> 01:29:32,188
Yes?

1385
01:29:32,938 --> 01:29:37,730
Thank you. If it weren't for you,
the others wouldn't have let me go.

1386
01:29:39,605 --> 01:29:41,813
Love you, Dad.

1387
01:29:51,772 --> 01:29:53,980
Hello, congratulations.

1388
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:57,188
I wish them the best.

1389
01:29:59,063 --> 01:30:01,355
Hello. How are you?

1390
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:20,313
Ladies, on the 2nd via the elevator.
Gentlemen, stairs to the 1st.

1391
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,188
Hello. How are you?

1392
01:30:22,355 --> 01:30:24,063
Hello, welcome!

1393
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,397
What a pleasure to see you!

1394
01:30:28,272 --> 01:30:30,397
Congratulations!

1395
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:39,813
<i>Welcome to this marvelous evening.</i>

1396
01:30:40,105 --> 01:30:43,813
<i>I want to hear your applause!</i>

1397
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,022
<i>Ladies up there, too!</i>

1398
01:30:54,147 --> 01:30:58,230
<i>What an honor for me to name</i>

1399
01:30:58,397 --> 01:31:02,230
<i>the late Gholam Jourablou's
successor tonight.</i>

1400
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:04,355
<i>Thank you!</i>

1401
01:31:04,522 --> 01:31:07,272
<i>What a great atmosphere!</i>

1402
01:31:14,938 --> 01:31:18,480
<i>Keep it up!
No slowing down now!</i>

1403
01:31:18,647 --> 01:31:20,855
<i>We're in for a long night!</i>

1404
01:31:22,397 --> 01:31:24,355
<i>Thank you.</i>

1405
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,188
<i>What a night!</i>

1406
01:31:28,647 --> 01:31:32,563
<i>And now the time has come
to name the patriarch.</i>

1407
01:31:33,063 --> 01:31:37,438
<i>On this day, in this hour,
in this glorious second,</i>

1408
01:31:38,313 --> 01:31:39,980
<i>the name of the patriarch</i>

1409
01:31:40,147 --> 01:31:43,397
<i>of the family born
of the dynasty of the Jourablou clan,</i>

1410
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:46,272
<i>as wished by Gholam,</i>

1411
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,105
<i>is now going to be officially announced.</i>

1412
01:31:50,688 --> 01:31:53,397
<i>And the name is Mr...</i>

1413
01:31:53,647 --> 01:31:56,563
<i>Esmail Jourablou!</i>

1414
01:31:57,188 --> 01:32:01,772
<i>Bring the house down with your applause!</i>

1415
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:07,355
<i>I want to hear you
until the end of the night!</i>

1416
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:11,772
<i>Again and again, make more noise!</i>

1417
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,063
<i>Classy!</i>

1418
01:32:21,855 --> 01:32:23,605
<i>Encourage him now!</i>

1419
01:32:23,772 --> 01:32:27,105
<i>Until the end of the night!</i>

1420
01:32:27,272 --> 01:32:31,480
<i>I want to hear
each and every one of you!</i>

1421
01:32:31,855 --> 01:32:34,188
<i>Let's congratulate him!</i>

1422
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:48,188
<i>You're not whistling loud enough!</i>

1423
01:33:21,605 --> 01:33:23,772
Congratulations, my boy.

1424
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:28,105
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1425
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:31,522
<i>Music.</i>

1426
01:33:31,688 --> 01:33:34,147
<i>One, two, three, four...</i>

1427
01:34:23,605 --> 01:34:26,563
<i>As we wait for the band to tune up,</i>

1428
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:30,938
<i>it is a great honor for me</i>

1429
01:34:31,105 --> 01:34:35,355
<i>to invite Mr. Jourablou and the groom</i>

1430
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,688
<i>out on the dance floor.</i>

1431
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,522
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1432
01:34:40,272 --> 01:34:41,813
<i>Please.</i>

1433
01:34:42,355 --> 01:34:44,230
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

1434
01:34:45,938 --> 01:34:47,647
<i>Thank you!</i>

1435
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:52,188
<i>The family patriarch is fabulous!</i>

1436
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:56,480
<i>The band: One, two, three, four!</i>

1437
01:38:35,813 --> 01:38:36,980
Leila!

1438
01:38:56,813 --> 01:38:57,980
Stop!

1439
01:39:02,688 --> 01:39:04,063
Leila, wait!

1440
01:39:08,355 --> 01:39:09,480
Stop!

1441
01:39:09,647 --> 01:39:12,522
Why're you doing this?
It's a lifetime of disgrace.

1442
01:39:12,855 --> 01:39:14,230
My brothers are unemployed.

1443
01:39:14,522 --> 01:39:16,397
Give me the coins.
You're scaring me.

1444
01:39:16,563 --> 01:39:19,605
What're you afraid of?
Your brothers will be overjoyed.

1445
01:39:19,897 --> 01:39:24,313
If they find out what you've done,
they'll kill you.

1446
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,980
I told you
to let Dad come to this wedding.

1447
01:39:27,147 --> 01:39:28,897
He is at the wedding!

1448
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:30,563
This is worse than if he wasn't.

1449
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,897
I didn't want him to come.

1450
01:39:33,063 --> 01:39:34,272
It's his money!

1451
01:39:34,438 --> 01:39:35,647
It's his children's due!

1452
01:39:35,813 --> 01:39:39,022
You're wasting your time.
I don't have the coins here!

1453
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:41,730
Stop being such a chicken.
Go back,

1454
01:39:41,897 --> 01:39:44,438
get a grip
and set your brothers up for life.

1455
01:39:44,605 --> 01:39:47,105
I won't go anywhere without the coins.

1456
01:39:47,272 --> 01:39:50,688
Bayram just wants us
to pay for his son's wedding!

1457
01:39:50,855 --> 01:39:54,313
That's what was planned.
It's none of our business.

1458
01:39:54,813 --> 01:39:57,272
It's my business!
I won't give them to you.

1459
01:39:57,438 --> 01:39:59,313
What am I going to say?

1460
01:39:59,605 --> 01:40:03,272
Nothing. Go back, that's all.
They won't have a choice.

1461
01:40:03,605 --> 01:40:06,772
Let's give them the coins
and take them back later.

1462
01:40:07,188 --> 01:40:08,188
How?

1463
01:40:08,355 --> 01:40:09,897
We'll beg them,

1464
01:40:10,063 --> 01:40:12,938
threaten them, curse them,
you name it.

1465
01:40:13,105 --> 01:40:15,980
They fear nothing
because they believe in nothing.

1466
01:40:16,147 --> 01:40:18,605
Go! Don't make it worse
for our brothers.

1467
01:40:18,772 --> 01:40:21,355
You want me to go
watch them be ridiculed?

1468
01:40:21,522 --> 01:40:23,480
Dad is the patriarch now.

1469
01:40:23,647 --> 01:40:25,230
Everyone has to obey him.

1470
01:40:25,397 --> 01:40:30,022
Have him announce
that he's canceling the gift tradition.

1471
01:40:30,188 --> 01:40:34,563
Dad cares about them more than us.
He would never ruin their wedding.

1472
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:35,812
Go back,

1473
01:40:35,813 --> 01:40:38,022
look Bayram in the eye
and tell him

1474
01:40:38,188 --> 01:40:40,313
to pay for our gift himself.

1475
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:41,772
What if he refuses?

1476
01:40:41,938 --> 01:40:44,272
He'll be forced to deal with it.

1477
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:45,647
Don't be afraid.

1478
01:40:45,813 --> 01:40:49,272
Be firm.
He'll eat out of your hand, you'll see.

1479
01:40:51,647 --> 01:40:53,855
I can't! I'm coming with you.

1480
01:40:54,355 --> 01:40:55,397
Go back!

1481
01:41:21,272 --> 01:41:24,397
Any gift under 500,
round it up with this.

1482
01:41:24,563 --> 01:41:27,063
- And double the coins.
- Yes, sir.

1483
01:41:29,772 --> 01:41:31,397
- How much?
- Half a coin.

1484
01:41:32,563 --> 01:41:34,605
One coin for Mr. Bapiri.

1485
01:41:34,772 --> 01:41:35,772
Thank you.

1486
01:41:35,897 --> 01:41:38,813
Give 500 to Hassan.

1487
01:41:42,522 --> 01:41:44,313
- How're you?
- Why're you here?

1488
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:46,272
What's all this?

1489
01:41:47,105 --> 01:41:49,022
Same as for any wedding.

1490
01:41:49,438 --> 01:41:50,438
Meaning?

1491
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:54,813
We inflate the smaller gifts
to create hype.

1492
01:41:55,647 --> 01:41:57,772
We need you to do it for us, as well.

1493
01:41:58,438 --> 01:41:59,438
You're kidding?

1494
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:00,813
I'm not.

1495
01:42:01,147 --> 01:42:03,397
Step out so we can talk.

1496
01:42:17,022 --> 01:42:18,605
What's going on?

1497
01:42:18,772 --> 01:42:20,772
You need to help us out.

1498
01:42:21,022 --> 01:42:23,230
We invited you to help us out.

1499
01:42:23,397 --> 01:42:24,897
- We don't have the coins.
- What?

1500
01:42:25,063 --> 01:42:26,897
We need coins.

1501
01:42:27,272 --> 01:42:28,355
You're kidding me?

1502
01:42:28,522 --> 01:42:30,105
You give them coins.

1503
01:42:30,272 --> 01:42:34,647
Not at all.
They give them back in the other room.

1504
01:42:34,813 --> 01:42:36,813
Over here. I can't hear you.

1505
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,272
- Tell me.
- We don't have them.

1506
01:42:44,438 --> 01:42:45,897
I just talked to your dad.

1507
01:42:46,063 --> 01:42:48,355
- And?
- He said you had 40 coins.

1508
01:42:48,522 --> 01:42:50,313
I swear I don't have a cent.

1509
01:42:50,605 --> 01:42:52,647
This is not the time.
Let me count.

1510
01:42:52,813 --> 01:42:54,438
I swear there are no coins.

1511
01:42:54,772 --> 01:42:57,772
I insisted your dad accept
only if he could afford it.

1512
01:42:57,938 --> 01:42:59,688
I didn't force him.

1513
01:42:59,855 --> 01:43:01,730
No, you melted his heart.

1514
01:43:06,272 --> 01:43:09,230
Give me 35.
I'll have them announce 40.

1515
01:43:09,397 --> 01:43:12,438
Do us a favor,
give the entire amount in our name.

1516
01:43:12,855 --> 01:43:13,937
Let me talk to him.

1517
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,480
My dad can't find out.
Help us.

1518
01:43:16,647 --> 01:43:20,897
What about my reputation?
Your gift was paying for the venue.

1519
01:43:21,063 --> 01:43:22,688
You could've gone elsewhere.

1520
01:43:23,188 --> 01:43:25,980
And marry my only son
in a parking lot like you?

1521
01:43:26,313 --> 01:43:28,105
What do you want to do?

1522
01:43:28,272 --> 01:43:31,397
That's the way things stand.
There's no turning back.

1523
01:43:31,563 --> 01:43:34,272
You idiot,
there's no turning back for you.

1524
01:43:34,647 --> 01:43:37,647
You're marrying your son,
and my dad is the patriarch.

1525
01:43:38,022 --> 01:43:40,230
Ghardashali is here with 50 coins.

1526
01:43:40,605 --> 01:43:42,272
In his pocket?

1527
01:43:42,438 --> 01:43:44,605
In his checkbook.
Know what that is?

1528
01:43:44,772 --> 01:43:46,272
Ghardashali's pathetic.

1529
01:43:46,438 --> 01:43:49,230
Less than you.
He's not ruining the wedding.

1530
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:51,688
My father is the patriarch.

1531
01:43:51,855 --> 01:43:55,522
I can have him cancel
the wedding gifts.

1532
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:58,772
Are you threatening me?

1533
01:43:59,313 --> 01:44:00,438
Suppose I am.

1534
01:44:03,522 --> 01:44:07,397
When your father accepted,
he signed a contract

1535
01:44:07,563 --> 01:44:09,147
saying he'd give 40 coins.

1536
01:44:09,313 --> 01:44:13,438
I'll do you the favor
of not pressing charges.

1537
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:18,855
Now, keep a low profile, eat your dinner
and go back to your hovel.

1538
01:44:19,022 --> 01:44:21,813
He's 80 and sick.
You can't do this to him.

1539
01:44:22,147 --> 01:44:24,605
You whining little shit,

1540
01:44:24,772 --> 01:44:28,480
threatening me when you think you can,
begging when you can't!

1541
01:44:28,647 --> 01:44:31,105
Everything they say about you people
is true.

1542
01:44:31,272 --> 01:44:34,355
You're a bunch of lazy, retarded bums!

1543
01:44:34,772 --> 01:44:36,897
Don't ruin your son's wedding.

1544
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:40,063
Who wants to ruin my son's wedding?

1545
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:42,105
Esmail-the-beggar's son?

1546
01:44:45,438 --> 01:44:49,188
My brothers
won't listen to you like I have.

1547
01:44:49,522 --> 01:44:52,355
Go tell your brothers
to spoil the party.

1548
01:44:52,522 --> 01:44:53,522
Do it!

1549
01:44:55,188 --> 01:44:58,772
Cousin,
I've been begging you for an hour.

1550
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:02,688
Shut your mouth.
Go tell them to ruin the party.

1551
01:45:02,855 --> 01:45:05,022
Who were you counting on to spoil it?

1552
01:45:05,397 --> 01:45:08,438
Your degenerate brothers
or your imbecile father?

1553
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:12,730
I can tie both my legs and an arm

1554
01:45:12,897 --> 01:45:14,772
and still beat the four of you.

1555
01:45:14,938 --> 01:45:17,730
Want me to kick your father
off that stage,

1556
01:45:17,897 --> 01:45:19,980
make you get on all fours

1557
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:22,772
and sit Ghardashali on your backs?

1558
01:45:22,938 --> 01:45:24,397
Want that?

1559
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:31,355
If any of you bat an eyelid tonight,

1560
01:45:31,522 --> 01:45:34,688
I'll make mincemeat of you all

1561
01:45:34,855 --> 01:45:37,688
and feed you to my son for his wedding.

1562
01:46:04,522 --> 01:46:06,563
DJ! Switch it off!

1563
01:47:55,022 --> 01:47:56,813
<i>The time has come</i>

1564
01:47:56,980 --> 01:48:01,063
<i>to present the gifts,
but with a minor change.</i>

1565
01:48:01,605 --> 01:48:03,522
<i>Luckily, nowadays,</i>

1566
01:48:03,688 --> 01:48:06,522
<i>we can talk our differences through.</i>

1567
01:48:08,522 --> 01:48:11,730
<i>Tonight,
at the request of our patriarch,</i>

1568
01:48:11,897 --> 01:48:14,855
<i>Mr. Esmail Jourablou,</i>

1569
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:19,730
<i>the first gift will be presented
by Mr. Ghardashali Jourablou.</i>

1570
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:26,563
<i>Esmail, our guest of honor,
will keep us company with his sons.</i>

1571
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,855
<i>And now...</i>

1572
01:48:29,313 --> 01:48:31,022
<i>let me present,</i>

1573
01:48:31,397 --> 01:48:35,605
<i>on this day, at this hour,
in this glorious second,</i>

1574
01:48:35,772 --> 01:48:37,730
<i>the family patriarch</i>

1575
01:48:37,938 --> 01:48:41,188
<i>and successor
to the late Gholam Jourablou,</i>

1576
01:48:41,355 --> 01:48:45,397
<i>Mr. Ghardashali Jourablou!</i>

1577
01:49:41,938 --> 01:49:43,147
<i>I congratulate you</i>

1578
01:49:43,313 --> 01:49:46,147
<i>for all the applause and energy.</i>

1579
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,897
<i>The first gift,</i>

1580
01:49:52,063 --> 01:49:53,688
<i>offered by the family patriarch,</i>

1581
01:49:53,855 --> 01:49:57,688
<i>Mr. Ghardashali Jourablou.</i>

1582
01:49:57,855 --> 01:49:59,313
<i>70 million tomans.</i>

1583
01:50:00,147 --> 01:50:03,855
<i>The equivalent of 50 gold coins.</i>

1584
01:50:04,022 --> 01:50:07,105
<i>Blessed he be!</i>

1585
01:50:07,272 --> 01:50:08,730
<i>Thank you!</i>

1586
01:50:12,563 --> 01:50:14,313
<i>Well done!</i>

1587
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:49,772
Why are you locking the door?
Wait, Esmail.

1588
01:50:49,938 --> 01:50:51,563
Don't lock the door.

1589
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:53,813
Come back, please.

1590
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,855
I'll make you some nice tea.

1591
01:50:57,022 --> 01:50:59,438
Take your opium, you'll feel better.

1592
01:50:59,605 --> 01:51:01,105
Come here.

1593
01:51:07,522 --> 01:51:10,897
In two days, the price of coins
has gone up by 200,000.

1594
01:51:11,355 --> 01:51:13,272
- How much did you sell them?
- 1.4 million.

1595
01:51:13,605 --> 01:51:14,855
What time do we get up?

1596
01:51:15,022 --> 01:51:16,938
Leila, wake me up at 7.

1597
01:51:17,105 --> 01:51:20,230
You were all in on it?

1598
01:51:20,397 --> 01:51:24,563
Manouchehr's sleeping here
because he sold his apartment.

1599
01:51:25,188 --> 01:51:29,188
Farhad sold his car,
and is picking up the money at 8 a.m.

1600
01:51:29,355 --> 01:51:31,730
At 10, we're signing for the shop.

1601
01:51:31,897 --> 01:51:35,188
Without telling me?
Why'd you drag me into this?

1602
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:38,022
Without you,
it wouldn't have worked.

1603
01:51:38,438 --> 01:51:40,522
But you did it all yourselves.

1604
01:51:40,688 --> 01:51:42,105
With your help.

1605
01:51:42,438 --> 01:51:44,105
I got played.

1606
01:51:44,272 --> 01:51:47,855
If I'd had a say,
you wouldn't have bought the shop.

1607
01:51:48,355 --> 01:51:50,522
Alireza, you handled it perfectly.

1608
01:51:50,688 --> 01:51:53,772
Hats off to you.
I would've had a heart attack.

1609
01:51:53,938 --> 01:51:55,355
- Right?
- Yup.

1610
01:51:55,522 --> 01:51:57,522
Why didn't you say anything?

1611
01:51:57,813 --> 01:52:01,147
We did and you refused.
We didn't insist.

1612
01:52:01,313 --> 01:52:04,647
What's troubling you?
You did a good job.

1613
01:52:05,063 --> 01:52:06,480
What job?

1614
01:52:06,647 --> 01:52:08,480
You think I'm an idiot?

1615
01:52:08,647 --> 01:52:12,147
He's right.
You weren't supposed to be in on it.

1616
01:52:12,313 --> 01:52:14,188
We did the thinking,
you performed.

1617
01:52:14,355 --> 01:52:15,688
And you did good.

1618
01:52:15,855 --> 01:52:18,022
You were thinking for me?

1619
01:52:18,605 --> 01:52:20,438
You should tell us

1620
01:52:20,605 --> 01:52:22,980
whose name
goes on the paperwork tomorrow.

1621
01:52:23,147 --> 01:52:25,480
The deed
will be issued in that name.

1622
01:52:26,105 --> 01:52:29,522
Dad's, of course,
so we can look him in the eye again.

1623
01:52:29,688 --> 01:52:31,813
So he can sell the shop out of spite?

1624
01:52:32,105 --> 01:52:33,938
Or give it to Bayram.

1625
01:52:34,105 --> 01:52:35,897
Leila signs.

1626
01:52:36,147 --> 01:52:37,522
"Leila & Bros." sounds nice.

1627
01:52:37,897 --> 01:52:41,647
It's not my shop.
One of you has to sign.

1628
01:52:41,813 --> 01:52:42,813
Like who?

1629
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,132
Take a vote.

1630
01:52:44,147 --> 01:52:47,563
Farhad thinks with his pecs,

1631
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:49,105
so not him.

1632
01:52:49,772 --> 01:52:54,772
Parviz is overweight
and might have a heart attack any time.

1633
01:52:54,938 --> 01:52:55,979
Not him either.

1634
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:57,063
And you're a thief.

1635
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:58,980
You'll end up in jail.

1636
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:01,563
- So not me.
- That leaves Alireza.

1637
01:53:01,938 --> 01:53:03,313
I vote for Alireza.

1638
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:05,105
Logical.

1639
01:53:05,688 --> 01:53:06,688
Leila?

1640
01:53:07,105 --> 01:53:08,188
I abstain.

1641
01:53:08,355 --> 01:53:10,272
- Who do you vote for?
- I'm not saying.

1642
01:53:10,438 --> 01:53:11,938
- You have to.
- And you?

1643
01:53:12,105 --> 01:53:14,938
I won't vote.
But you're not voting for me, right?

1644
01:53:15,105 --> 01:53:16,522
Not anymore.

1645
01:53:16,688 --> 01:53:18,230
Why not?

1646
01:53:19,313 --> 01:53:20,397
'Cause you're a coward.

1647
01:53:20,897 --> 01:53:22,688
That's why you're shouting.

1648
01:53:22,855 --> 01:53:24,938
We spare you
and you get excited.

1649
01:53:25,647 --> 01:53:27,355
I made you stay

1650
01:53:27,522 --> 01:53:30,063
to save you
from your shitty lives.

1651
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:32,022
But you just don't see it.

1652
01:53:32,272 --> 01:53:35,938
Who got us into deep shit tonight?

1653
01:53:36,313 --> 01:53:39,272
How dare you defend
your asshole father.

1654
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:42,105
Have you no shame?

1655
01:53:42,272 --> 01:53:45,772
You humiliated that poor,
naive, old man so badly,

1656
01:53:45,938 --> 01:53:50,022
till his death he won't forget
what he went through tonight.

1657
01:53:50,188 --> 01:53:52,397
All you see is him?
What about them?

1658
01:53:52,563 --> 01:53:57,480
Because of you
there's no affection left between them.

1659
01:53:57,647 --> 01:53:59,855
They're forced to live together.

1660
01:54:00,022 --> 01:54:01,397
That's not my doing.

1661
01:54:01,563 --> 01:54:05,313
They're here. They know the parents
better than you do.

1662
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:09,730
They don't show up every 8 years
in a hurry to leave again.

1663
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:12,772
Mom and Dad may be senile now,

1664
01:54:13,188 --> 01:54:15,647
but tonight, I saw it with my own eyes.

1665
01:54:15,813 --> 01:54:19,522
I saw that you're behind
everyone's misfortune here.

1666
01:54:51,855 --> 01:54:55,813
Sign all three pages of this copy,
as well.

1667
01:55:02,563 --> 01:55:03,897
Congratulations.

1668
01:55:04,063 --> 01:55:05,605
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1669
01:55:05,772 --> 01:55:08,897
Thank you for everything.

1670
01:55:09,063 --> 01:55:10,605
This is your copy.

1671
01:55:11,272 --> 01:55:13,147
Mr. Property Owner!

1672
01:55:13,313 --> 01:55:14,355
Alireza...

1673
01:55:14,772 --> 01:55:18,480
- Thank you, sir.
- Can you hand me an envelope?

1674
01:55:20,708 --> 01:55:21,741
Here you go.

1675
01:55:21,772 --> 01:55:23,647
Congratulations.

1676
01:55:23,813 --> 01:55:24,813
Congratulations to you!

1677
01:55:24,938 --> 01:55:26,855
See you tonight.

1678
01:55:37,647 --> 01:55:38,772
'Evening.

1679
01:55:43,438 --> 01:55:45,063
Already here?

1680
01:55:45,813 --> 01:55:48,230
You should've waited a few days.

1681
01:55:55,813 --> 01:55:57,813
He hasn't come out yet?

1682
01:55:59,105 --> 01:56:00,230
Dad?

1683
01:56:00,897 --> 01:56:03,313
Mom says he hasn't eaten
or taken his pills.

1684
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:05,772
Hasn't even gone to the bathroom.

1685
01:56:06,647 --> 01:56:08,188
Maybe something's happened?

1686
01:56:08,355 --> 01:56:10,438
No, I can hear his lighter.

1687
01:56:10,938 --> 01:56:12,897
Thank you for this, Ali.

1688
01:56:13,063 --> 01:56:15,272
Don't make things worse, Mom.

1689
01:56:15,438 --> 01:56:16,605
Dad...

1690
01:56:16,772 --> 01:56:19,772
What you did to your father last night,

1691
01:56:19,938 --> 01:56:22,688
no one would do to their worst enemy.

1692
01:56:22,855 --> 01:56:26,188
Soon, you won't know
how to thank us for last night.

1693
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:28,813
We didn't do anything wrong.

1694
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:32,147
We bought a shop
in one of the best malls of Tehran.

1695
01:56:33,355 --> 01:56:36,480
Dad, it's the mall where I work.

1696
01:56:36,647 --> 01:56:38,188
It's legit.

1697
01:56:38,355 --> 01:56:41,688
We didn't buy it just with your coins.

1698
01:56:41,855 --> 01:56:44,438
We pitched in everything we had.

1699
01:56:44,605 --> 01:56:47,397
Come see it tomorrow.
If you don't like it...

1700
01:56:48,022 --> 01:56:50,688
Stop talking nonsense.

1701
01:56:50,855 --> 01:56:53,522
Whatever next? Go back inside.

1702
01:56:53,688 --> 01:56:56,272
Parviz, he's fine. Go inside.

1703
01:57:04,522 --> 01:57:06,688
Dad, don't listen to them.

1704
01:57:06,855 --> 01:57:08,522
I'm the one who signed.

1705
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:10,063
I have the deed.

1706
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:15,272
Let's go tomorrow.
If you like it, it's yours.

1707
01:57:16,063 --> 01:57:20,897
And if you don't like it,
I swear I'll cancel the sale.

1708
01:57:21,397 --> 01:57:24,063
I'll buy back your coins
and give them to you.

1709
01:57:25,063 --> 01:57:27,772
But first, come see the place.

1710
01:57:30,605 --> 01:57:31,855
Dad?

1711
01:57:43,938 --> 01:57:45,438
This way, Dad.

1712
01:57:46,063 --> 01:57:48,022
Our shop will be here.

1713
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:51,147
Right here.

1714
01:57:52,938 --> 01:57:54,063
Look.

1715
01:57:55,522 --> 01:57:56,522
This is it.

1716
01:58:08,688 --> 01:58:11,355
Wait, Dad. Let me explain.

1717
01:58:11,522 --> 01:58:15,397
Buying this shop
is a very good decision.

1718
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:18,438
I'm telling you this,

1719
01:58:18,605 --> 01:58:23,397
and I swear I wasn't in the know
at the wedding.

1720
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:26,563
Business is so good here,

1721
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:29,563
that they're replacing the toilets
with eight shops.

1722
01:58:30,272 --> 01:58:32,522
We'll have the best one.

1723
01:58:32,688 --> 01:58:34,938
Our shop will be 6.5 by 10 feet.

1724
01:58:35,105 --> 01:58:37,563
The shopfront will be 10 feet wide.

1725
01:58:37,855 --> 01:58:41,355
It'll start exactly here.

1726
01:58:41,522 --> 01:58:45,563
One, two, three...
All the way to the back.

1727
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:47,147
All that...

1728
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:48,813
Sorry.

1729
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,147
And in this direction, 6.5 feet

1730
01:58:53,313 --> 01:58:55,438
to the hallway we came in from.

1731
01:58:55,605 --> 01:58:56,688
You saw it.

1732
01:58:56,855 --> 01:59:01,438
Next to a couple of the best shops.
It's an excellent location.

1733
01:59:01,605 --> 01:59:03,313
It's a popular spot.

1734
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:07,647
They gave it to us
because Leila and Parviz work here.

1735
01:59:08,313 --> 01:59:12,688
Dad, try to forget what you're hearing
and seeing here today.

1736
01:59:12,855 --> 01:59:16,063
In three months, you'll love it.

1737
01:59:16,313 --> 01:59:20,313
Come spend a day with me, you'll see.

1738
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:21,563
Dad...

1739
01:59:21,730 --> 01:59:24,688
The four of us will work hard.

1740
01:59:24,855 --> 01:59:26,772
We're gonna make a buck.

1741
01:59:28,230 --> 01:59:30,188
Much good may it do you.

1742
01:59:31,105 --> 01:59:32,563
I'll see you in court.

1743
01:59:33,272 --> 01:59:35,397
Why in court, Dad?

1744
01:59:35,563 --> 01:59:39,147
Think of it as a buildable lot.

1745
01:59:39,313 --> 01:59:42,563
Don't you trust my economic instinct?

1746
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:45,980
Didn't you save those coins
for your kids' future?

1747
01:59:46,147 --> 01:59:47,355
The future is now.

1748
01:59:47,522 --> 01:59:49,397
I don't want kids like you.

1749
01:59:49,855 --> 01:59:52,647
Alireza, I trusted you.

1750
01:59:52,813 --> 01:59:55,105
It was the worst mistake of my life.

1751
01:59:56,647 --> 02:00:00,605
You removed my crown
to buy bathroom stalls?

1752
02:00:01,063 --> 02:00:03,980
Give me my coins back right now!

1753
02:00:04,147 --> 02:00:06,647
Leila works here. This is awkward.
Listen...

1754
02:00:06,813 --> 02:00:07,855
I won't listen!

1755
02:00:08,022 --> 02:00:09,897
I mortgaged the house.

1756
02:00:10,063 --> 02:00:12,272
If I don't return them,
you'll all be homeless.

1757
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:13,813
A mortgage?

1758
02:00:14,647 --> 02:00:17,647
I got a mortgage to buy the coins.

1759
02:00:17,813 --> 02:00:19,563
You're humiliating me again.

1760
02:00:19,730 --> 02:00:22,063
You shouldn't have had kids!

1761
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:24,897
And stop shouting, you old fool.
People are staring!

1762
02:00:25,063 --> 02:00:26,063
Shut up!

1763
02:00:27,105 --> 02:00:28,813
- I had you...
- Cool it.

1764
02:00:30,022 --> 02:00:32,730
I fed and raised you.

1765
02:00:32,897 --> 02:00:35,188
Now go fuck yourselves!

1766
02:00:35,938 --> 02:00:38,897
Why should I support you
in your forties?

1767
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:42,022
- Why?
- Calm down.

1768
02:00:43,563 --> 02:00:44,772
My gold coins.

1769
02:00:45,563 --> 02:00:46,647
OK!

1770
02:00:47,688 --> 02:00:49,772
He's going to pass out.

1771
02:00:50,188 --> 02:00:51,271
Dad!

1772
02:00:51,272 --> 02:00:52,313
He's passing out!

1773
02:00:53,105 --> 02:00:54,480
Call an ambulance!

1774
02:00:56,522 --> 02:00:58,188
Dad, I'm sorry.

1775
02:01:00,313 --> 02:01:01,980
We need sugar.

1776
02:01:02,730 --> 02:01:04,605
Call an ambulance.

1777
02:01:04,897 --> 02:01:05,938
Some water, please.

1778
02:01:09,605 --> 02:01:10,605
Dad!

1779
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:20,063
Talk!

1780
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:21,772
Gimme that!

1781
02:01:29,730 --> 02:01:31,397
I'm exhausted.

1782
02:01:33,063 --> 02:01:35,022
I can't do this anymore.

1783
02:01:35,188 --> 02:01:37,480
I can't...

1784
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:41,480
Prices are rocketing.

1785
02:01:41,938 --> 02:01:44,980
It could even get worse than this.

1786
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,605
Then before it gets out of hand,

1787
02:01:47,772 --> 02:01:51,105
we should return the shop
and buy his coins back.

1788
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:57,397
You'll have to kill me

1789
02:01:57,813 --> 02:01:59,397
to return that shop.

1790
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,480
Do you know
why he's panicking like this?

1791
02:02:05,772 --> 02:02:09,813
He put a mortgage on the house
to buy the coins.

1792
02:02:13,938 --> 02:02:14,938
Says who?

1793
02:02:15,647 --> 02:02:16,813
Him.

1794
02:02:18,605 --> 02:02:21,313
- He couldn't.
- He did.

1795
02:02:21,855 --> 02:02:24,897
If he hadn't, he wouldn't be here.

1796
02:02:49,772 --> 02:02:52,980
Leila didn't see the scene
he made at the mall.

1797
02:02:53,147 --> 02:02:56,522
It was payback for being dethroned.

1798
02:02:56,688 --> 02:02:58,938
Payback?
He's the one in the hospital.

1799
02:02:59,105 --> 02:03:02,605
Leila's plan aside,

1800
02:03:02,772 --> 02:03:06,147
I never would've thought
Bayram would do this to Dad.

1801
02:03:06,313 --> 02:03:08,730
Me neither. It's hard to believe.

1802
02:03:08,897 --> 02:03:11,813
Leila couldn't have guessed
he'd go so far.

1803
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:15,605
You think if Leila had known
Bayram would kick Dad off stage,

1804
02:03:15,772 --> 02:03:17,980
she wouldn't have taken the coins?

1805
02:03:18,855 --> 02:03:21,188
We return them
or we lose the house.

1806
02:03:21,688 --> 02:03:24,272
We'll return them, of course.

1807
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:25,980
Thanks to the shop.

1808
02:03:26,147 --> 02:03:28,272
We're going to lose him.

1809
02:03:28,897 --> 02:03:32,105
If anything happens to him,
you won't see me again.

1810
02:03:33,605 --> 02:03:34,855
Too bad.

1811
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:40,480
You think he'll surrender?
He'll resist until it kills him.

1812
02:03:41,772 --> 02:03:42,897
Let him die.

1813
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:50,188
For once in his life,
he found money at the right time.

1814
02:03:50,355 --> 02:03:53,313
And instead of letting Bayram
extort him,

1815
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,897
we put it to good use.

1816
02:03:56,063 --> 02:03:58,855
You call your dirty tricks good use?

1817
02:03:59,022 --> 02:04:00,605
Pretend we got a loan.

1818
02:04:00,772 --> 02:04:02,272
He's going to die.

1819
02:04:03,063 --> 02:04:04,438
He lost face.

1820
02:04:04,605 --> 02:04:07,063
His house is at stake.
He can't breathe.

1821
02:04:07,355 --> 02:04:08,855
Imagine he'd given it to Bayram.

1822
02:04:09,147 --> 02:04:11,147
He wouldn't be in intensive care.

1823
02:04:11,438 --> 02:04:13,438
And we wouldn't have a shop.

1824
02:04:13,772 --> 02:04:16,313
Dad cursed that shop.

1825
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:19,022
It'll never turn a profit.

1826
02:04:19,188 --> 02:04:20,188
Parviz?

1827
02:04:20,355 --> 02:04:23,105
I've been this guy's son for 50 years.

1828
02:04:23,272 --> 02:04:25,022
Half a century.

1829
02:04:25,188 --> 02:04:27,647
When he digs in his heels,

1830
02:04:27,813 --> 02:04:30,730
he goes all the way.

1831
02:04:30,897 --> 02:04:32,313
Alireza's right.

1832
02:04:32,772 --> 02:04:35,980
He won't let up until he drops dead.

1833
02:04:36,438 --> 02:04:38,438
By the time
the shop's up and running,

1834
02:04:38,605 --> 02:04:41,897
we'll have lost our house
and everything.

1835
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:45,355
At what cost
will we start a business?

1836
02:04:46,063 --> 02:04:49,188
There's a huge waiting list
for that shop.

1837
02:04:49,355 --> 02:04:51,772
At what cost
will we lose this opportunity?

1838
02:04:51,938 --> 02:04:54,272
At the cost of our roof.

1839
02:04:55,938 --> 02:04:58,980
At the cost of our father's life.

1840
02:04:59,147 --> 02:05:01,855
But to you, that's worth nothing.

1841
02:05:03,647 --> 02:05:04,813
Manouchehr.

1842
02:05:09,105 --> 02:05:10,313
Nothing to add?

1843
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,897
Nothing you'll like hearing.

1844
02:05:14,813 --> 02:05:16,605
Doesn't matter. Say it anyway.

1845
02:05:16,772 --> 02:05:20,772
For the shop to turn a profit,
we'll need time and capital.

1846
02:05:20,938 --> 02:05:22,188
We have neither.

1847
02:05:22,355 --> 02:05:26,772
That shop is a good investment,
even if it stays closed.

1848
02:05:26,938 --> 02:05:31,438
Even if we were to lose the house,
which we won't.

1849
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:36,355
If he'd given the coins to Bayram,
how would he have returned them?

1850
02:05:36,522 --> 02:05:37,522
We'll do the same.

1851
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:42,980
He didn't think about
how he'd pay them back.

1852
02:05:43,147 --> 02:05:46,355
He just wanted to be
up on that stage.

1853
02:05:46,522 --> 02:05:49,105
We're capable of anything
in this family.

1854
02:05:49,272 --> 02:05:51,855
If we lose the house,
we'll be homeless.

1855
02:05:52,105 --> 02:05:54,855
The potential of that shop
is beyond compare.

1856
02:05:55,022 --> 02:05:57,897
With it,
all of you will become homeowners.

1857
02:05:58,063 --> 02:05:59,980
We're doing this for us.

1858
02:06:00,147 --> 02:06:02,147
We also invested our money.

1859
02:06:02,313 --> 02:06:05,022
So our opinion should count, too.

1860
02:06:05,188 --> 02:06:06,188
Let's take a vote.

1861
02:06:06,563 --> 02:06:08,022
A vote?

1862
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:12,563
Alireza...

1863
02:06:13,688 --> 02:06:17,855
have you brainwashed them
into returning the shop?

1864
02:06:20,022 --> 02:06:23,188
Will you accept the consequences
or share the blame?

1865
02:06:45,563 --> 02:06:48,813
You'll remember this night
for the rest of your lives.

1866
02:06:51,438 --> 02:06:54,647
You'll regret
making this absurd decision

1867
02:06:54,813 --> 02:06:57,063
and not listening to me.

1868
02:06:57,522 --> 02:07:01,688
You are ruining
the biggest opportunity of your lives.

1869
02:07:02,397 --> 02:07:06,063
You're sentencing yourselves
to eternal poverty, here and now.

1870
02:07:52,605 --> 02:07:54,230
Are you sure?

1871
02:07:56,938 --> 02:07:58,188
Cancel it.

1872
02:08:11,397 --> 02:08:12,897
Hello.

1873
02:08:13,063 --> 02:08:14,813
I'd like 40 gold coins.

1874
02:08:15,188 --> 02:08:16,188
2.5 million each.

1875
02:08:16,313 --> 02:08:19,730
You mean 1.5 million?
We just sold them for 1.4.

1876
02:08:19,897 --> 02:08:21,355
No, man. It's 2.5 now.

1877
02:08:22,605 --> 02:08:23,647
But why?

1878
02:08:23,813 --> 02:08:27,397
The US wants to abandon
the nuclear deal. Excuse me.

1879
02:08:27,563 --> 02:08:29,522
They want to. They haven't yet.

1880
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:31,021
We'll see.

1881
02:08:31,022 --> 02:08:32,438
Can you buzz us out?

1882
02:08:32,605 --> 02:08:33,855
They won't do it.

1883
02:08:34,272 --> 02:08:35,480
Hello.

1884
02:08:36,897 --> 02:08:38,063
We want 40 coins.

1885
02:08:38,355 --> 02:08:41,188
3 million each.
That makes 120 million.

1886
02:08:42,438 --> 02:08:45,355
It was 100 million across the street.
2.5 each.

1887
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:47,772
Tomorrow, it'll be 150.

1888
02:08:47,938 --> 02:08:50,105
Can I ask you a question?

1889
02:08:50,272 --> 02:08:52,647
For 40 coins, should we wait or buy?

1890
02:08:52,813 --> 02:08:56,188
- Wait. Prices might come down.
- Will they?

1891
02:08:59,313 --> 02:09:01,480
We came earlier.

1892
02:09:01,855 --> 02:09:04,355
For 40 coins
can you give us a discount?

1893
02:09:04,688 --> 02:09:07,063
The site was just updated.
It's now 3 million.

1894
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:12,188
But we were just here.

1895
02:09:12,355 --> 02:09:13,355
What can I say?

1896
02:09:21,813 --> 02:09:26,355
Right now, on line,
40 coins are going for 200 million.

1897
02:09:26,522 --> 02:09:27,938
Before it was 100 million.

1898
02:09:28,105 --> 02:09:29,146
Before...

1899
02:09:29,147 --> 02:09:30,647
We don't know what's going on.

1900
02:09:30,813 --> 02:09:33,647
It's nuts. 5 million per coin?

1901
02:09:33,813 --> 02:09:35,397
No way, it's a bubble.

1902
02:09:35,563 --> 02:09:37,438
Next week
it should go back down to 1.

1903
02:09:37,772 --> 02:09:40,480
See, even he says so.

1904
02:09:42,647 --> 02:09:43,647
Thanks.

1905
02:09:49,688 --> 02:09:50,938
What do we do, Manouchehr?

1906
02:09:51,105 --> 02:09:53,105
We buy before it goes higher.

1907
02:09:53,272 --> 02:09:56,605
If no one buys,
they'll have to bring prices down.

1908
02:09:56,938 --> 02:09:57,938
The bubble will pop.

1909
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,813
Mr. Economist,

1910
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:02,522
it's a stainless-steel bubble.
It won't pop.

1911
02:10:02,688 --> 02:10:06,230
Taxi driver analysis.
I say we don't buy.

1912
02:10:06,397 --> 02:10:07,563
It's up to you.

1913
02:10:07,897 --> 02:10:11,313
How many can you buy
with all the money?

1914
02:10:11,897 --> 02:10:13,147
About 30.

1915
02:10:13,313 --> 02:10:14,938
Buy them, then.

1916
02:10:15,355 --> 02:10:17,563
Manouchehr says it'll come back down.

1917
02:10:17,897 --> 02:10:20,397
I've lived in this country for 70 years,

1918
02:10:20,563 --> 02:10:23,522
I've never seen prices come down.

1919
02:10:23,897 --> 02:10:25,980
They have to want them to.

1920
02:10:26,147 --> 02:10:28,522
May God help my children.

1921
02:10:28,688 --> 02:10:32,563
I'm afraid if we buy at 5 mil,
the next day it'll go down to 1.

1922
02:10:39,105 --> 02:10:41,105
Thank you sir, bye.

1923
02:10:42,355 --> 02:10:44,688
Hello, sir.

1924
02:10:45,897 --> 02:10:47,063
We want some gold coins.

1925
02:10:47,083 --> 02:10:48,186
How many?

1926
02:10:48,188 --> 02:10:49,188
40.

1927
02:10:52,688 --> 02:10:53,855
320 million.

1928
02:10:55,730 --> 02:10:57,813
One gold coin costs 8 million?

1929
02:10:58,355 --> 02:11:01,938
The dollar just went
from 3,000 to 19,000. It's normal.

1930
02:11:02,105 --> 02:11:04,188
You agree that it's a bubble?

1931
02:11:04,355 --> 02:11:06,688
The dollar's set to cross
the 30,000 mark.

1932
02:11:07,105 --> 02:11:10,063
Yesterday, a coin cost 6.
After Trump's speech,

1933
02:11:10,230 --> 02:11:13,147
it went up to 7.
After his tweet, 8.

1934
02:11:18,563 --> 02:11:19,563
Thank you, sir.

1935
02:11:20,022 --> 02:11:21,688
You're welcome. Have a nice day.

1936
02:11:22,355 --> 02:11:24,188
Is a tweet a bomb?

1937
02:11:24,772 --> 02:11:27,063
No, but even a bomb shouldn't do this.

1938
02:11:27,313 --> 02:11:28,397
Let's go, Dad.

1939
02:13:17,022 --> 02:13:19,563
A gold coin now costs 14 million.

1940
02:13:19,813 --> 02:13:21,813
The US dollar is at 28,000.

1941
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:23,772
Stop it, that's enough.

1942
02:13:23,938 --> 02:13:27,355
Damn whoever's responsible for this.

1943
02:13:28,563 --> 02:13:31,522
You sold the car 19 million, Farhad?

1944
02:13:31,688 --> 02:13:32,688
Yes.

1945
02:13:33,063 --> 02:13:34,980
Now it's worth 100 million.

1946
02:13:35,397 --> 02:13:37,647
Still think it's a bubble?

1947
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,230
If you had that shop,

1948
02:13:41,397 --> 02:13:44,438
it would be worth
at least six times as much now.

1949
02:13:44,813 --> 02:13:47,688
If that's the case, go get it back.

1950
02:13:50,855 --> 02:13:52,522
What did you say, Dad?

1951
02:13:52,938 --> 02:13:54,938
They'll never agree.

1952
02:13:55,105 --> 02:13:57,563
No harm in asking.

1953
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:13,147
The US dollar
crossed the 30,000 mark.

1954
02:14:17,147 --> 02:14:19,313
We can return three of Dad's coins.

1955
02:14:19,855 --> 02:14:21,897
Is that supposed to be funny?

1956
02:14:22,563 --> 02:14:24,272
You don't give a shit.

1957
02:14:29,772 --> 02:14:30,772
Check out the car.

1958
02:14:37,522 --> 02:14:39,230
That's not a car, it's a tank.

1959
02:15:29,563 --> 02:15:32,980
You'll get a stiff neck!
They're gone.

1960
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:41,688
If we'd taken over your friend's office,
we'd each have one of those cars.

1961
02:15:42,063 --> 02:15:43,563
And one of those girls.

1962
02:15:43,730 --> 02:15:46,730
All that fat
is interfering with your brain.

1963
02:15:46,897 --> 02:15:51,355
If we'd taken over,
we'd owe a thousand times 120 mil!

1964
02:15:52,063 --> 02:15:53,522
I think just the opposite.

1965
02:15:53,813 --> 02:15:56,522
That's all you do, think the opposite.

1966
02:15:56,855 --> 02:16:01,522
Prides were going for 20 million,
now they're 116.

1967
02:16:01,938 --> 02:16:04,355
I presold 915 Prides.

1968
02:16:05,313 --> 02:16:09,105
Know what 915 times 116 million
comes to?

1969
02:16:09,522 --> 02:16:12,522
106 billion 140 million tomans!

1970
02:16:12,688 --> 02:16:16,313
And not one customer
accepts their original 20.

1971
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:21,022
We had two months to deliver.
I have ten days left.

1972
02:16:21,688 --> 02:16:23,022
I have 10 days

1973
02:16:23,188 --> 02:16:25,272
to either deliver 915 cars

1974
02:16:25,438 --> 02:16:28,480
or come up
with 106 billion and 140 million.

1975
02:16:28,647 --> 02:16:32,688
If prices stop going up.

1976
02:16:36,688 --> 02:16:37,980
Well done.

1977
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:50,647
So what do we do?

1978
02:16:51,355 --> 02:16:53,522
My calculations were perfect.

1979
02:16:53,688 --> 02:16:56,438
If prices hadn't shot up, we'd be rich.

1980
02:16:56,980 --> 02:16:59,438
What's the solution now?

1981
02:16:59,730 --> 02:17:01,772
I say we sue the guy.

1982
02:17:02,105 --> 02:17:04,563
I signed a contract.
What do you think?

1983
02:17:04,730 --> 02:17:07,438
Then turn yourself in
and settle this.

1984
02:17:08,063 --> 02:17:09,897
What if I can't settle it?

1985
02:17:10,272 --> 02:17:11,897
What if I get 20 years?

1986
02:17:12,188 --> 02:17:14,022
Is your roommate at that office?

1987
02:17:14,438 --> 02:17:16,230
No, I'm managing it.

1988
02:17:16,813 --> 02:17:17,938
Where is he now?

1989
02:17:18,105 --> 02:17:19,188
I don't know.

1990
02:17:19,438 --> 02:17:20,563
He's gone.

1991
02:17:21,188 --> 02:17:24,188
I looked for him.
He's nowhere to be found.

1992
02:17:33,063 --> 02:17:36,313
Then you have to leave the country.

1993
02:17:38,313 --> 02:17:41,230
People run away
with the money they embezzle.

1994
02:17:41,397 --> 02:17:44,105
With us,
someone else enjoys the money.

1995
02:17:44,272 --> 02:17:46,272
We get to run away.

1996
02:17:46,438 --> 02:17:50,647
He's a loser.
If he goes abroad, he'll die of hunger.

1997
02:17:50,813 --> 02:17:52,313
Do you even have a passport?

1998
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:56,522
Not a problem. Farhad's passport
still has my picture on it.

1999
02:17:57,313 --> 02:18:00,522
I just have to not get caught
at the airport.

2000
02:18:16,855 --> 02:18:18,938
I wasn't gonna leave it handy.

2001
02:18:19,688 --> 02:18:21,230
I know you're upset.

2002
02:18:22,022 --> 02:18:24,480
I ruined all your documents.

2003
02:18:24,647 --> 02:18:27,813
Keep it if you want,
but I swear this is the last time.

2004
02:18:30,188 --> 02:18:31,813
Not to mention it's risky.

2005
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:33,563
If I get caught, I could get life.

2006
02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:35,230
You're leaving for good?

2007
02:18:35,563 --> 02:18:37,772
- He can't stay.
- What can I do?

2008
02:18:37,938 --> 02:18:39,355
He has to go for good.

2009
02:18:39,647 --> 02:18:42,105
If he leaves like this,
we won't see him again.

2010
02:18:42,272 --> 02:18:43,480
How can he leave?

2011
02:18:43,647 --> 02:18:45,897
Now's not the time, Farhad.

2012
02:18:46,355 --> 02:18:48,230
What do you need your passport for?

2013
02:18:48,563 --> 02:18:50,272
I don't mean my passport.

2014
02:18:50,438 --> 02:18:53,480
I mean how can he not get caught?

2015
02:18:53,647 --> 02:18:55,813
Piss me off and I won't hand it over.

2016
02:19:21,647 --> 02:19:22,688
Here.

2017
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:25,897
I never did anything with it.

2018
02:19:32,688 --> 02:19:34,313
Send money if you can.

2019
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:37,772
If you can't, don't come back
and don't call too often.

2020
02:19:39,897 --> 02:19:43,980
If you do, tell us you're doing great,

2021
02:19:44,147 --> 02:19:46,105
with a good job and good money.

2022
02:19:51,730 --> 02:19:55,647
It'd be nice if we could be reassured
about you at least.

2023
02:20:28,563 --> 02:20:31,272
What if they arrest him at the airport?

2024
02:20:31,647 --> 02:20:34,313
You guys are right, I'm a coward.

2025
02:20:37,522 --> 02:20:39,605
You may not believe this,

2026
02:20:39,772 --> 02:20:42,355
but I'm even afraid of good things.

2027
02:20:44,188 --> 02:20:45,688
When all is well,

2028
02:20:45,855 --> 02:20:48,855
I wait for something bad to happen.

2029
02:20:49,897 --> 02:20:51,522
Even Maryam,

2030
02:20:51,688 --> 02:20:54,188
I couldn't keep her
because she was too good.

2031
02:20:55,438 --> 02:21:00,855
At the factory, I chose a girl
who didn't suit me from the get-go.

2032
02:21:01,022 --> 02:21:04,147
And I finally broke up with her
for those reasons.

2033
02:21:05,022 --> 02:21:09,855
I don't like imperfection,
and perfection scares me.

2034
02:21:10,022 --> 02:21:11,355
What's that mean?

2035
02:21:12,188 --> 02:21:14,688
I was afraid of the shop.

2036
02:21:15,147 --> 02:21:18,522
I'm even afraid of happiness.

2037
02:21:21,105 --> 02:21:25,147
You were taught what to think
and not how to think.

2038
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:41,688
Give him something he likes, at least.

2039
02:21:41,855 --> 02:21:44,188
- You know him.
- No time to be picky.

2040
02:21:44,355 --> 02:21:47,147
Don't get worked up,
I'll pack it myself.

2041
02:21:47,522 --> 02:21:49,105
This is how you help him leave?

2042
02:21:51,272 --> 02:21:54,147
You're the one
who put him out on the street.

2043
02:21:54,438 --> 02:21:56,313
Who? Me?

2044
02:21:56,730 --> 02:21:58,313
Who else?

2045
02:21:58,480 --> 02:22:00,688
Isn't attack the best form of defense?

2046
02:22:00,855 --> 02:22:02,063
What're you saying, Mom?

2047
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:05,897
She's worse than her brothers.

2048
02:22:06,063 --> 02:22:09,063
If she cared at all,
she'd die of shame.

2049
02:22:09,230 --> 02:22:10,397
Don't start, Dad.

2050
02:22:10,730 --> 02:22:13,730
Don't, Leila. I'll do it.

2051
02:22:13,897 --> 02:22:15,605
You don't know how to pack.

2052
02:22:16,147 --> 02:22:17,855
Go upstairs before it degenerates.

2053
02:22:18,022 --> 02:22:21,980
What wench did your mother use
as a model to make you?

2054
02:22:22,147 --> 02:22:24,188
- She looked in the mirror.
- Shut up.

2055
02:22:24,355 --> 02:22:27,272
We'd have been better off
if you'd been sterile.

2056
02:22:27,438 --> 02:22:29,188
Why me?

2057
02:22:29,355 --> 02:22:33,272
My sons were living their lives
and earning their crust.

2058
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:37,813
She's the one who should be sterile,
she caused their misfortune.

2059
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:39,147
That's enough, Mom.

2060
02:22:39,313 --> 02:22:42,063
If we start finger-pointing,
we'll all in for it.

2061
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:44,188
They already started.

2062
02:22:44,355 --> 02:22:46,647
If you're jobless, whose fault is it?

2063
02:22:46,813 --> 02:22:49,313
If Manouchehr is fleeing,
whose fault is it?

2064
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:52,022
If we're humiliated,

2065
02:22:52,188 --> 02:22:54,772
if we're made fun of
by friend and foe?

2066
02:22:55,272 --> 02:22:56,313
Mom...

2067
02:22:57,313 --> 02:22:59,855
Why can't the two of you just die?

2068
02:23:00,022 --> 02:23:03,605
Thank God,
it's you pain is killing every day.

2069
02:23:03,772 --> 02:23:05,397
That's enough.

2070
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:09,897
I wouldn't be like this
if I wasn't your maid.

2071
02:23:10,063 --> 02:23:11,438
I gave birth to a lady.

2072
02:23:11,605 --> 02:23:13,105
You chose to become a maid.

2073
02:23:13,272 --> 02:23:16,313
You bitch, you love only yourself.

2074
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:21,313
You hate all women.
Don't make me laugh.

2075
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:23,730
You know why they're up shit creek?

2076
02:23:23,897 --> 02:23:27,438
Because they were raised
by you two morons.

2077
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:32,480
You favor your husband over your sons,
and your sons over your daughter.

2078
02:23:32,647 --> 02:23:35,438
You've left your daughter to inherit
nothing but misery.

2079
02:23:35,605 --> 02:23:39,688
I had to go into debt at my age
and I'm still keeping a grip.

2080
02:23:39,855 --> 02:23:41,563
Into debt?

2081
02:23:42,022 --> 02:23:44,647
Will you ever stop lying?

2082
02:23:45,647 --> 02:23:48,272
Haven't you had your revenge?

2083
02:23:55,063 --> 02:23:57,272
Isn't this the deed to the house?

2084
02:23:58,313 --> 02:24:02,480
Didn't you make them
return the shop for this?

2085
02:24:02,688 --> 02:24:03,772
Where did you leave it?

2086
02:24:04,772 --> 02:24:06,938
Why is it hidden here?

2087
02:24:07,522 --> 02:24:10,313
He's had a secret account for 20 years.

2088
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:12,938
He bought the coins with his own money.

2089
02:24:13,605 --> 02:24:16,109
Mom, who put them out on the street?

2090
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:17,147
Who, Dad?

2091
02:24:17,313 --> 02:24:21,897
Me or you, who meddled in our affairs
until we were all miserable?

2092
02:24:22,938 --> 02:24:25,188
You didn't pay for his studies.

2093
02:24:25,355 --> 02:24:27,772
You didn't let him
marry the girl he loved.

2094
02:24:28,147 --> 02:24:30,313
Is no one going to stop this brat?

2095
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:31,813
Brat?

2096
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:35,105
Brats are children
who haven't had an upbringing.

2097
02:24:35,730 --> 02:24:39,397
Who haven't been encouraged
when they do good.

2098
02:24:39,563 --> 02:24:41,813
Or punished when they do wrong.

2099
02:24:42,563 --> 02:24:45,313
Punishment was reserved for children.

2100
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:48,563
But sometimes adults need punishing

2101
02:24:48,730 --> 02:24:51,188
for them to stop
wrecking people's lives.

2102
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:52,897
What have you done?

2103
02:24:53,230 --> 02:24:54,938
What've you done, Leila?

2104
02:24:55,105 --> 02:24:58,980
Leila, what the hell did you just do?

2105
02:24:59,147 --> 02:25:02,272
Leila! How could you? Stay here.

2106
02:25:03,188 --> 02:25:05,730
I'm gonna kill you!

2107
02:25:05,897 --> 02:25:07,063
Come apologize.

2108
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:10,438
Curse her!

2109
02:25:29,022 --> 02:25:32,647
Leila, may God curse you.

2110
02:26:13,753 --> 02:26:14,812
Here you go.

2111
02:26:14,813 --> 02:26:16,688
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

2112
02:27:49,688 --> 02:27:51,480
Your phone, sir.

2113
02:27:51,994 --> 02:27:53,062
Why?

2114
02:27:53,063 --> 02:27:54,772
They're no longer authorized.

2115
02:28:01,522 --> 02:28:04,772
The factory owes you 12 months of wages.

2116
02:28:05,063 --> 02:28:08,063
But the factory has closed.

2117
02:28:08,397 --> 02:28:10,480
Management has worked hard

2118
02:28:10,647 --> 02:28:13,313
to pay you 3 months of those wages.

2119
02:28:13,897 --> 02:28:15,022
And the rest?

2120
02:28:15,188 --> 02:28:17,230
The point is that's all you'll get.

2121
02:28:17,563 --> 02:28:20,855
I lost my benefits.
I need the full amount.

2122
02:28:21,022 --> 02:28:23,230
We can only pay 3 months.

2123
02:28:23,397 --> 02:28:28,563
And you have to sign a statement
saying our debt's been settled.

2124
02:28:28,855 --> 02:28:30,855
You'll be paid in cash.

2125
02:28:31,022 --> 02:28:34,022
You owe us a year's worth of wages,

2126
02:28:34,188 --> 02:28:37,272
and you're offering 3 months
after 90% depreciation?

2127
02:28:37,438 --> 02:28:40,813
Don't harp on.
I explained it already.

2128
02:28:40,980 --> 02:28:43,563
Whoever's interested can line up.

2129
02:28:46,861 --> 02:28:47,937
Where you going?

2130
02:28:47,938 --> 02:28:49,688
I want what I'm owed.

2131
02:28:49,980 --> 02:28:51,438
What I worked for.

2132
02:28:51,855 --> 02:28:53,438
You'll lose even this.

2133
02:28:54,647 --> 02:28:55,938
It's up to you.

2134
02:31:12,272 --> 02:31:14,105
Not on the floor.

2135
02:31:14,272 --> 02:31:17,272
Take these plates and silverware.

2136
02:31:23,647 --> 02:31:25,230
Hello!

2137
02:31:25,397 --> 02:31:26,688
Thank you.

2138
02:31:26,855 --> 02:31:29,647
You girls look lovely!
Here's my gift, sweetie.

2139
02:31:29,813 --> 02:31:32,438
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Happy birthday!

2140
02:31:32,605 --> 02:31:36,480
Look at those beautiful dresses.

2141
02:31:37,272 --> 02:31:42,230
Let's see
who can blow one up fastest.

2142
02:31:42,605 --> 02:31:43,855
One...

2143
02:31:44,313 --> 02:31:45,354
Two...

2144
02:31:45,355 --> 02:31:47,691
There's a present for the winner.

2145
02:31:47,692 --> 02:31:48,730
Three.

2146
02:32:06,147 --> 02:32:08,313
Uncle, did you lose?

2147
02:32:09,147 --> 02:32:11,813
He got scared. He's running away.

2148
02:32:13,313 --> 02:32:14,355
Dad...

2149
02:32:17,230 --> 02:32:18,480
Daddy dearest...

2150
02:32:21,897 --> 02:32:22,897
Dad...

2151
02:32:26,813 --> 02:32:27,873
Dad.

2152
02:33:57,313 --> 02:33:58,396
Come in.

2153
02:33:58,397 --> 02:34:01,438
Welcome, my little angels.

2154
02:34:03,563 --> 02:34:04,688
Here they are!

2155
02:34:05,272 --> 02:34:07,313
Come in.

2156
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:09,563
Come in, my lovelies.

2157
02:34:13,063 --> 02:34:14,230
Dad...

2158
02:34:49,022 --> 02:34:51,605
Uncle, come dance!

2159
02:34:52,397 --> 02:34:54,480
Come on, stand up.

2160
02:36:46,938 --> 02:36:52,563
